# Circuit-Breaker                          #
############################################

# A boolean specifying whether the circuit breaker should be enabled or not.
# When enabled, the agent periodically polls stress monitors to detect system/process/JVM stress state.
# If ANY of the monitors detects a stress indication, the agent will become inactive, as if the
# &lt;&lt;config-recording,`recording`&gt;&gt; configuration option has been set to `false`, thus reducing resource consumption to a minimum.
# When inactive, the agent continues polling the same monitors in order to detect whether the stress state
# has been relieved. If ALL monitors approve that the system/process/JVM is not under stress anymore, the
# agent will resume and become fully functional.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: Boolean
# Default value: false
#
# circuit_breaker_enabled=false

# The interval at which the agent polls the stress monitors. Must be at least `1s`.
#
# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: TimeDuration
# Supports the duration suffixes ms, s and m. Example: 5s.
# Default value: 5s
#
# stress_monitoring_interval=5s

# The threshold used by the GC monitor to rely on for identifying heap stress.
# The same threshold will be used for all heap pools, so that if ANY has a usage percentage that crosses it,
# the agent will consider it as a heap stress. The GC monitor relies only on memory consumption measured
# after a recent GC.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: Double
# Default value: 0.95
#
# stress_monitor_gc_stress_threshold=0.95

# The threshold used by the GC monitor to rely on for identifying when the heap is not under stress .
# If `stress_monitor_gc_stress_threshold` has been crossed, the agent will consider it a heap-stress state.
# In order to determine that the stress state is over, percentage of occupied memory in ALL heap pools should
# be lower than this threshold. The GC monitor relies only on memory consumption measured after a recent GC.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: Double
# Default value: 0.75
#
# stress_monitor_gc_relief_threshold=0.75

# The minimal time required in order to determine whether the system is
# either currently under stress, or that the stress detected previously has been relieved.
# All measurements during this time must be consistent in comparison to the relevant threshold in
# order to detect a change of stress state. Must be at least `1m`.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: TimeDuration
# Supports the duration suffixes ms, s and m. Example: 1m.
# Default value: 1m
#
# stress_monitor_cpu_duration_threshold=1m

# The threshold used by the system CPU monitor to detect system CPU stress.
# If the system CPU crosses this threshold for a duration of at least `stress_monitor_cpu_duration_threshold`,
# the monitor considers this as a stress state.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: Double
# Default value: 0.95
#
# stress_monitor_system_cpu_stress_threshold=0.95

# The threshold used by the system CPU monitor to determine that the system is
# not under CPU stress. If the monitor detected a CPU stress, the measured system CPU needs to be below
# this threshold for a duration of at least `stress_monitor_cpu_duration_threshold` in order for the
# monitor to decide that the CPU stress has been relieved.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: Double
# Default value: 0.8

# NOTE: This option was available in older versions through the `active` key. The old key is still
# supported in newer versions, but it is now deprecated.
#
# A boolean specifying if the agent should be recording or not.
# When recording, the agent instruments incoming HTTP requests, tracks errors and collects and sends metrics.
# When not recording, the agent works as a noop, not collecting data and not communicating with the APM sever,
# except for polling the central configuration endpoint.
# As this is a reversible switch, agent threads are not being killed when inactivated, but they will be
# mostly idle in this state, so the overhead should be negligible.
#
# You can use this setting to dynamically disable Elastic APM at runtime.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: Boolean
# Default value: true
#
# recording=true

# Setting to false will completely disable the agent, including instrumentation and remote config polling.
# If you want to dynamically change the status of the agent, use &lt;&lt;config-recording,`recording`&gt;&gt; instead.
#
# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: Boolean
# Default value: true
#
# enabled=true

# A boolean specifying if the agent should instrument the application to collect traces for the app.
#  When set to `false`, most built-in instrumentation plugins are disabled, which would minimize the effect on
# your application. However, the agent would still apply instrumentation related to manual tracing options and it
# would still collect and send metrics to APM Server.
#
# NOTE: Both active and instrument needs to be true for instrumentation to be running.
#
# NOTE: Changing this value at runtime can slow down the application temporarily.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: Boolean
# Default value: true
#
# instrument=true

# The name of your service
#
# This is used to keep all the errors and transactions of your service together
# and is the primary filter in the Elastic APM user interface.
#
# Instead of configuring the service name manually,
# you can also choose to rely on the service name auto-detection mechanisms of the agent.
# If `service_name` is set explicitly, all auto-detection mechanisms are disabled.
#
# This is how the service name auto-detection works:
#
# * For standalone applications
# ** The agent uses `Implementation-Title` in the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file if the application is started via `java -jar`.
# ** Falls back to the name of the main class or jar file.
# * For applications that are deployed to a servlet container/application server, the agent auto-detects the name for each application.
# ** For Spring-based applications, the agent uses the `spring.application.name` property, if set.
# ** For servlet-based applications, falls back to the `Implementation-Title` in the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file.
# ** Falls back to the `display-name` of the `web.xml`, if available.
# ** Falls back to the servlet context path the application is mapped to (unless mapped to the root context).
#
# Generally, it is recommended to rely on the service name detection based on `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`.
# Spring Boot automatically adds the relevant manifest entries.
# For other applications that are built with Maven, this is how you add the manifest entries:
#
#
# [source,xml]
# .pom.xml

#
# The service name must conform to this regular expression: `^[a-zA-Z0-9 _-]+$`.
# In less regexy terms:
# Your service name must only contain characters from the ASCII alphabet, numbers, dashes, underscores and spaces.
#
# NOTE: Service name auto discovery mechanisms require APM Server 7.0+.
#
# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: String
# Default value: Auto-detected based on the rules described above
#
#
# service_name=

# A unique name for the service node
#
# If set, this name is used to distinguish between different nodes of a service,
# therefore it should be unique for each JVM within a service.
# If not set, data aggregations will be done based on a container ID (where valid) or on the reported
# hostname (automatically discovered or manually configured through &lt;&lt;config-hostname, `hostname`&gt;&gt;).
#
# NOTE: JVM metrics views rely on aggregations that are based on the service node name.
# If you have multiple JVMs installed on the same host reporting data for the same service name,
# you must set a unique node name for each in order to view metrics at the JVM level.
#
# NOTE: Metrics views can utilize this configuration since APM Server 7.5
#
# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: String
# Default value:
#
# service_node_name=

# A version string for the currently deployed version of the service. If you don’t version your deployments, the recommended value for this field is the commit identifier of the deployed revision, e.g. the output of git rev-parse HEAD.
#
# Similar to the auto-detection of &lt;&lt;config-service-name&gt;&gt;, the agent can auto-detect the service version based on the `Implementation-Title` attribute in `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`.
# See &lt;&lt;config-service-name&gt;&gt; on how to set this attribute.
#
#
#
# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: String
# Default value:
#
# service_version=

# Allows for the reported hostname to be manually specified. If unset the hostname will be looked up.
#
# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: String
# Default value:
#
# hostname=

# The name of the environment this service is deployed in, e.g. "production" or "staging".
#
# Environments allow you to easily filter data on a global level in the APM app.
# It's important to be consistent when naming environments across agents.
# See {apm-app-ref}/filters.html#environment-selector[environment selector] in the APM app for more information.
#
# NOTE: This feature is fully supported in the APM app in Kibana versions &gt;= 7.2.
# You must use the query bar to filter for a specific environment in versions prior to 7.2.
#
# This setting can not be changed at runtime. Changes require a restart of the application.
# Type: String
# Default value:
#
# environment=

# By default, the agent will sample every transaction (e.g. request to your service). To reduce overhead and storage requirements, you can set the sample rate to a value between 0.0 and 1.0. We still record overall time and the result for unsampled transactions, but no context information, labels, or spans.
#
# Value will be rounded with 4 significant digits, as an example, value '0.55555' will be rounded to `0.5556`
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: Double
# Default value: 1
#
# transaction_sample_rate=1

# Limits the amount of spans that are recorded per transaction.
#
# This is helpful in cases where a transaction creates a very high amount of spans (e.g. thousands of SQL queries).
#
# Setting an upper limit will prevent overloading the agent and the APM server with too much work for such edge cases.
#
# A message will be logged when the max number of spans has been exceeded but only at a rate of once every 5 minutes to ensure performance is not impacted.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: Integer
# Default value: 500
#
# transaction_max_spans=500

# Sometimes it is necessary to sanitize the data sent to Elastic APM,
# e.g. remove sensitive data.
#
# Configure a list of wildcard patterns of field names which should be sanitized.
# These apply for example to HTTP headers and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data.
#
# This option supports the wildcard `*`, which matches zero or more characters.
# Examples: `/foo/*/bar/*/baz*`, `*foo*`.
# Matching is case insensitive by default.
# Prepending an element with `(?-i)` makes the matching case sensitive.
#
# NOTE: Data in the query string is considered non-sensitive,
# as sensitive information should not be sent in the query string.
# See https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Information_exposure_through_query_strings_in_url for more information
#
# NOTE: Review the data captured by Elastic APM carefully to make sure it does not capture sensitive information.
# If you do find sensitive data in the Elasticsearch index,
# you should add an additional entry to this list (make sure to also include the default entries).
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: comma separated list
# Default value: password,passwd,pwd,secret,*key,*token*,*session*,*credit*,*card*,*auth*,set-cookie

# capture the textual message body.
#
# If the HTTP request or the message has a body and this setting is disabled, the body will be shown as [REDACTED].
#
# This option is case-insensitive.
#
# NOTE: Currently, the body length is limited to 10000 characters and it is not configurable.
# If the body size exceeds the limit, it will be truncated.
#
# NOTE: Currently, only UTF-8 encoded plain text HTTP content types are supported.
# The option &lt;&lt;config-capture-body-content-types&gt;&gt; determines which content types are captured.
#
# WARNING: Request bodies often contain sensitive values like passwords, credit card numbers etc.
# If your service handles data like this, we advise to only enable this feature with care.

# A list of methods for which to create a transaction or span.
#
# If you want to monitor a large number of methods,
# use  &lt;&lt;config-profiling-inferred-spans-enabled, `profiling_inferred_spans_enabled`&gt;&gt; instead.
#
# This works by instrumenting each matching method to include code that creates a span for the method.
# While creating a span is quite cheap in terms of performance,
# instrumenting a whole code base or a method which is executed in a tight loop leads to significant overhead.
#
# Using a pointcut-like syntax, you can match based on
#
#  - Method modifier (optional) +
#    Example: `public`, `protected`, `private` or `*`
#  - Package and class name (wildcards include sub-packages) +
#    Example: `org.example.*`
#  - Method name (optional since 1.4.0) +
#    Example: `myMeth*d`
#  - Method argument types (optional) +
#    Example: `(*lang.String, int[])`
#  - Classes with a specific annotation (optional) +
#    Example: `@*ApplicationScoped`
#  - Classes with a specific annotation that is itself annotated with the given meta-annotation (optional) +
#    Example: `@@javax.enterpr*se.context.NormalScope`
#
# The syntax is `modifier @fully.qualified.AnnotationName fully.qualified.ClassName#methodName(fully.qualified.ParameterType)`.
#
# A few examples:
#
#  - `org.example.*` added:[1.4.0,Omitting the method is possible since 1.4.0]
#  - `org.example.*#*` (before 1.4.0, you need to specify a method matcher)
#  - `org.example.MyClass#myMethod`
#  - `org.example.MyClass#myMethod()`
#  - `org.example.MyClass#myMethod(java.lang.String)`
#  - `org.example.MyClass#myMe*od(java.lang.String, int)`
#  - `private org.example.MyClass#myMe*od(java.lang.String, *)`
#  - `* org.example.MyClas*#myMe*od(*.String, int[])`
#  - `public org.example.services.*Service#*`
#  - `public @java.inject.ApplicationScoped org.example.*`
#  - `public @java.inject.* org.example.*`
#  - `public @@javax.enterprise.context.NormalScope org.example.*, public @@jakarta.enterprise.context.NormalScope org.example.*`
#
# NOTE: Only use wildcards if necessary.
# The more methods you match the more overhead will be caused by the agent.
# Also note that there is a maximum amount of spans per transaction (see &lt;&lt;config-transaction-max-spans, `transaction_max_spans`&gt;&gt;).
#
# NOTE: The agent will create stack traces for spans which took longer than
# &lt;&lt;config-span-stack-trace-min-duration, `span_stack_trace_min_duration`&gt;&gt;.
# When tracing a large number of methods (for example by using wildcards),
# this may lead to high overhead.
# Consider increasing the threshold or disabling stack trace collection altogether.

# trace_methods=

# If &lt;&lt;config-trace-methods, `trace_methods`&gt;&gt; config option is set, provides a threshold to limit spans based on
# duration. When set to a value greater than 0, spans representing methods traced based on `trace_methods` will be discarded by default.
# Such methods will be traced and reported if one of the following applies:
#
#  - This method's duration crossed the configured threshold.
#  - This method ended with Exception.
#  - A method executed as part of the execution of this method crossed the threshold or ended with Exception.
#  - A "forcibly-traced method" (e.g. DB queries, HTTP exits, custom) was executed during the execution of this method.
#
# Set to 0 to disable.
#
# NOTE: Transactions are never discarded, regardless of their duration.
# This configuration affects only spans.
# In order not to break span references,

# The ECS log lines will include active trace/transaction/error IDs, if there are such.
#
# This option only applies to pattern layouts/formatters by default.
# See also &lt;&lt;config-log-ecs-formatter-allow-list, `log_ecs_formatter_allow_list`&gt;&gt;.
# To properly ingest and parse ECS JSON logs, follow the {ecs-logging-java-ref}/setup.html#setup-step-2[getting started guide].
#
# Available options:
#
#  - OFF - application logs are not reformatted.
#  - SHADE - agent logs are reformatted and "shade" ECS-JSON-formatted logs are automatically created in
#    addition to the original application logs. Shade logs will have the same name as the original logs,
#    but with the ".ecs.json" extension instead of the original extension. Destination directory for the
#    shade logs can be configured through the &lt;&lt;config-log-ecs-reformatting-dir,`log_ecs_reformatting_dir`&gt;&gt;
#    configuration. Shade logs do not inherit file-rollover strategy from the original logs. Instead, they
#    use their own size-based rollover strategy according to the &lt;&lt;config-log-file-size, `log_file_size`&gt;&gt;
#    configuration and while allowing maximum of two shade log files.
#  - REPLACE - similar to `SHADE`, but the original logs will not be written. This option is useful if
#    you wish to maintain similar logging-related overhead, but write logs to a different location and/or
#    with a different file extension.
#  - OVERRIDE - same log output is used, but in ECS-compatible JSON format instead of the original format.
#
# NOTE: while `SHADE` and `REPLACE` options are only relevant to file log appenders, the `OVERRIDE` option
# is also valid for other appenders, like System out and console.
#

# Stacktrace                               #
############################################

# Used to determine whether a stack trace frame is an 'in-app frame' or a 'library frame'.
# This allows the APM app to collapse the stack frames of library code,
# and highlight the stack frames that originate from your application.
# Multiple root packages can be set as a comma-separated list;
# there's no need to configure sub-packages.
# Because this setting helps determine which classes to scan on startup,
# setting this option can also improve startup time.
#
# You must set this option in order to use the API annotations `@CaptureTransaction` and `@CaptureSpan`.
#
# **Example**
#
# Most Java projects have a root package, e.g. `com.myproject`. You can set the application package using Java system properties:
# `-Delastic.apm.application_packages=com.myproject`
#
# If you are only interested in specific subpackages, you can separate them with commas:
# `-Delastic.apm.application_packages=com.myproject.api,com.myproject.impl`
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: comma separated list
# Default value:
#
# application_packages=

# Setting it to 0 will disable stack trace collection. Any positive integer value will be used as the maximum number of frames to collect. Setting it -1 means that all frames will be collected.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: Integer
# Default value: 50
#
# stack_trace_limit=50

# While this is very helpful to find the exact place in your code that causes the span, collecting this stack trace does have some overhead.
# When setting this option to value `0ms`, stack traces will be collected for all spans. Setting it to a positive value, e.g. `5ms`, will limit stack trace collection to spans with durations equal to or longer than the given value, e.g. 5 milliseconds.
#
# To disable stack trace collection for spans completely, set the value to `-1ms`.
#
# This setting can be changed at runtime
# Type: TimeDuration
# Supports the duration suffixes ms, s and m. Example: 5ms.
# Default value: 5ms
#
# span_stack_trace_min_duration=5ms</pre>
