<p>Periodically, you might need to upgrade an Elastic Cloud Enterprise installation as new versions with additional features become available. The upgrade process updates all hosts that are part of an Elastic Cloud Enterprise installation to the latest version of ECE, with little or no downtime for managed deployments.</p>
<h3><a id="ece-upgrade-overview"></a>The upgrade process<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-81/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-upgrading-ece.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Upgrading Elastic Cloud Enterprise works by replacing the <a class="xref" href="ece-glossary.html#container">containers</a> that ECE itself requires to run on each host.
Upgrading ECE does not touch any of the containers that run Elasticsearch clusters and Kibana instances. Each container that needs to be upgraded is renamed and stopped, followed by the creation of a new container with an upgraded instance of the ECE software and its dependencies. When the upgrade process has completed successfully, it cleans up after itself and removes the old containers.</p>
<p>The upgrade process creates a <code class="literal">frc-upgraders-monitor</code> container on the host where you initiate the process that performs the following actions:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Back up the ZooKeeper transaction log to <code class="literal">HOST_STORAGE_PATH/RUNNER_ID/services/zookeeper/data/backup</code>, where <code class="literal">HOST_STORAGE_PATH</code> and <code class="literal">RUNNER_ID</code> are specific to an ECE installation.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Configure Elastic Cloud Enterprise to perform the individual container upgrades by creating a <code class="literal">frc-upgraders-upgrader</code> container on each host that is part of the installation.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Monitor the upgrade process to ensure that all <code class="literal">frc-upgraders-upgrader</code> containers perform their part of the upgrade as expected and report their status.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
After all hosts have been upgraded successfully, clean up temporary artifacts created during the upgrade process, and remove the old containers.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The entire process is designed to be failsafe.  Containers get upgraded sequentially and the upgrade status of each container is tracked. The upgrade process also monitors that each new container is viable and continues to run as expected. If there is an issue with any part of the upgrade, <a class="xref" href="ece-issues.html#ece-troubleshooting-upgrade" title="Upgrade failures">the entire process is rolled back</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="ece-upgrade-recommendations"></a>Recommendations<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-81/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-upgrading-ece.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Before starting the upgrade process, check which of the following recommendations may apply for your setup:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Upgrading to 2.12.x or 2.13.0 is not recommended as it can cause issues and you may lose access to the admin console. You are strongly advised to upgrade to 2.13.1 and later.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you are upgrading to ECE versions 2.10, 2.11, or 2.12, refer to the ECE version 2.13 <a href="/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/2.12/ece-upgrade.html#ece-upgrade-system-deployments" class="ulink" target="_top">upgrade steps</a> for guidance about certain default ECE visualizations not working.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
We strongly recommend enabling XFS quotas, otherwise disk usage won&#8217;t display correctly. To enable XFS quotas, modify the entry for the XFS volume in the <code class="literal">/etc/fstab file</code> to add <code class="literal">pquota</code> and <code class="literal">prjquota</code>. The default filesystem path used by Elastic Cloud Enterprise is <code class="literal">/mnt/data</code>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
We strongly recommend that you routinely update your ECE installation to the most current version so that any bugs and security issues are fixed promptly. If you need to upgrade but are currently experiencing any issues with your platform, note that as long as ZooKeeper is running and healthy you should be able to upgrade (you can use the <a class="xref" href="get-runners.html" title="Get runners">get runners API</a> to easily verify the health of the runners on the <a class="xref" href="ece-architecture.html#ece-architecture-allocators" title="Allocators">ECE allocators</a>). That is, healthy system clusters are not required in order to perform an upgrade successfully.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Before upgrading to Elastic Cloud Enterprise 3.0, refer to the <a class="xref" href="ece-3-0-removals.html" title="Removals for ECE 3.0">lists of removals</a> to find out about features and API endpoints that are no longer supported.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>We strongly recommend that you do not attempt to perform certain actions during the upgrade process, such as:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">

</li>
<li class="listitem">

<span class="strong strong"><strong>Required user, roles and groups</strong></span> To run the script to upgrade Elastic Cloud Enterprise, login as the user used to run Elastic Cloud Enterprise (by default called <code class="literal">elastic</code> with UID/GID 1000). Initiate the upgrade process by running the <code class="literal">elastic-cloud-enterprise.sh</code> script with the <code class="literal">upgrade</code> action on a single host. The host that the script is run on must be a host that holds the director role. You do not need to run the script on additional hosts.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Available disk space</strong></span> Each host in the Elastic Cloud Enterprise installation must have at least 5 GB of disk space available to ensure that the upgrade process can complete successfully.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Proxies and load balancing</strong></span> To avoid any downtime for Elastic Cloud Enterprise, the installation must include more than one proxy and must use a load balancer as recommended. If only a single proxy is configured or if the installation is not using a load balancer, some downtime is expected when the containers on the proxies are upgraded. Each container upgrade typically takes five to ten seconds, times the number of containers on a typical host.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>For <em>offline</em> or <em>air-gapped</em> installations</strong></span> Additional steps are required to upgrade Elastic Cloud Enterprise. After downloading the installation script for the new version, pull and load the required container images and push them to a private Docker registry. To learn more about pulling and loading Docker images, check <a class="xref" href="ece-install-offline.html" title="Install ECE offline">Install ECE offline</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">

<p>If your ECE installation is still using the default, auto-generated certificates, we recommend performing one of the following steps to avoid trust errors related to the proxy server certificate after the upgrade. The proxy server certificate is used when connecting to Kibana and Elasticsearch clusters. During the upgrade, the ECE certificate authority generates a new certificate. As with any server certificate rotation, you must add an exception for the new proxy server certificate, unless the certificate authority is present in the trust store of the system or browser. You can perform either of these steps before or after the upgrade:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Recommended: <a class="xref" href="ece-manage-certificates.html" title="Manage security certificates">Add your organization&#8217;s own certificate</a> to Elastic Cloud Enterprise. The upgrade process ensures that the certificates you add do not change, which avoids the trust errors.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Add the default CA certificate to the trust store of your system or of your browser. Only the server certificate changes during upgrade, but the CA certificate remains the same. Adding the CA certificate to your trust store alone is sufficient to avoid the trust errors.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Apply valid license. It is required to have an <code class="literal">Enterprise resource unit</code>-compatible license applied before upgrading to ECE 2.7+. The most reliable way to check if your license is compatible is to use the Elastic Cloud Enterprise API and check the value of the license version field:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sh">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sh">curl -X GET -u admin:PASSWORD -k https://COORDINATOR_HOST:12443/api/v1/platform/license
{
  "license": {
    "version": 4,
    // other fields
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>If the version is not 4 or higher, you must request an updated license from <a class="xref" href="ece-getting-help.html" title="Ask for help">Elastic Support</a>. Once you receive your new license, make sure Elastic Cloud Enterprise is upgraded to at least version 2.5.0, and then upload the new license in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> page under the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Platform</strong></span> menu.</p>

<p>To upgrade an Elastic Cloud Enterprise installation, download the latest installation script. Login as the user used to run Elastic Cloud Enterprise (by default called <code class="literal">elastic</code> with UID/GID 1000), and run the script with the <code class="literal">upgrade</code> action on a single host that holds the director role:</p>
