<p>Due to the extensive changes in the new Elasticsearch .NET Client, we highly recommend
reviewing this documentation in full, before proceeding with migration to v8.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>After many months of work, eleven alphas, six betas and two release candidates,
we are pleased to announce the GA release of the Elasticsearch .NET Client v8.0.0.</p>
<p>The overall themes of this release have been based around redesigning the client
for the future, standardizing serialization, performance improvements, codebase
simplification, and code-generation.</p>
<p>The following release notes explain the current state of the client, missing
features, breaking changes and our rationale for some of the design choices we have introduced.</p>
<h3><a id="_version_8_is_a_refresh"></a>Version 8 is a refresh<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>It is important to highlight that v8 of the Elasticsearch .NET Client represents
a new start for the client design. It is important to review how this may affect
your code and usage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Mature code becomes increasingly hard to maintain over time, and
our ability to make timely releases has diminished as code complexity has increased.
Major releases allow us to simplify and better align our language clients with
each other in terms of design. Here, it is crucial to find the right balance
between uniformity across programming languages and the idiomatic concerns of
each language. For .NET, we will typically compare and contrast with <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-java" class="ulink" target="_top">Java</a> and <a href="https://github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch" class="ulink" target="_top">Go</a>
to make sure that our approach is equivalent for each of these. We also take
heavy inspiration from Microsoft framework design guidelines and the conventions
of the wider .NET community.</p>
<h4><a id="_new_elastic_clients_elasticsearch_nuget_package"></a>New Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch NuGet package<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>We have shipped the new code-generated client as a
<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch/" class="ulink" target="_top">new NuGet package</a>
with a new root namespace, <code class="literal">Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch</code>.
The new v8 client is built upon the foundations of the v7 <code class="literal">NEST</code> client, but there
are changes. By shipping as a new package, the expectation is that migration can
be managed with a phased approach.</p>
<p>While this is a new package, we have aligned the major version (v8.x.x) with the
supported Elasticsearch server version to clearly indicate the client/server compatibility.
The v8 client is designed to work with version 8 of Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>The v7 <code class="literal">NEST</code> client continues to be supported but will not gain new features or
support for new Elasticsearch endpoints. It should be considered deprecated in favour of
the new client.</p>
<h4><a id="_limited_feature_set"></a>Limited feature set<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<div class="caution admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The 8.0.0 Elasticsearch .NET Client does not have feature parity with the previous v7 <code class="literal">NEST</code>
high-level client.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For the initial 8.0.0 release we have limited the features we are shipping.
Over the course of the 8.x releases, we will reintroduce features. Therefore,
if something is missing, it may not be permanently omitted. We will endeavour to communicate our plans as and when they become available.</p>
<p>If a feature you depend on is missing (and not explicitly documented below as a
feature that we do not plan to reintroduce), please open <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/issues/new/choose" class="ulink" target="_top">an issue</a>
or comment on a relevant existing issue to highlight your need to us. This will
help us prioritise our roadmap.</p>
<h3><a id="_code_generation"></a>Code generation<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Given the size of the Elasticsearch API surface today, it is no longer practical
to maintain thousands of types (requests, responses, queries, aggregations, etc.)
by hand. To ensure consistent, accurate and timely alignment between language
clients and Elasticsearch, the 8.x clients, and many of the associated types are now
automatically code-generated from a <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification" class="ulink" target="_top">shared specification</a>. This is a common solution to maintaining alignment between
client and server among SDKs and libraries, such as those for Azure, AWS and the
Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p>Code-generation from a specification has inevitably led to some differences
between the existing v7 <code class="literal">NEST</code> types and those available in the new v7 Elasticsearch .NET Client.
For the 8.0.0 release, we generate strictly from the specification, special
casing a few areas to improve usability or to align with language idioms.</p>
<p>The base type hierarchy for concepts such as <code class="literal">Properties</code>, <code class="literal">Aggregations</code> and
<code class="literal">Queries</code> is no longer present in generated code, as these arbitrary groupings do
not align with concrete concepts of the public server API. These considerations
do not preclude adding syntactic sugar and usability enhancements to types in future
releases on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<h3><a id="_elastic_transport"></a>Elastic.Transport<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The .NET client includes a transport layer responsible for abstracting HTTP
concepts and to provide functionality such as our request pipeline. This
supports round-robin load-balancing of requests to nodes, pinging failed
nodes and sniffing the cluster for node roles.</p>
<p>In v7, this layer shipped as <code class="literal">Elasticsearch.Net</code> and was considered our low-level
client which could be used to send and receive raw JSON bytes between the client
and server.</p>
<p>As part of the work for 8.0.0, we have moved the transport layer out into
a <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Transport" class="ulink" target="_top">new dedicated package</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elastic-transport-net" class="ulink" target="_top">repository</a>, named
<code class="literal">Elastic.Transport</code>. This supports reuse across future clients and allows
consumers with extremely high-performance requirements to build upon this foundation.</p>
<h3><a id="_system_text_json_for_serialization"></a>System.Text.Json for serialization<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The v7 <code class="literal">NEST</code> high-level client used an internalized and modified version of
<a href="https://github.com/neuecc/Utf8Json" class="ulink" target="_top">Utf8Json</a> for request and response
serialization. This was introduced for its performance improvements
over <a href="https://www.newtonsoft.com/json" class="ulink" target="_top">Json.NET</a>, the more common JSON framework at
the time.</p>
<p>While Utf8Json provides good value, we have identified minor bugs and
performance issues that have required maintenance over time. Some of these
are hard to change without more significant effort. This library is no longer
maintained, and any such changes cannot easily be contributed back to the
original project.</p>
<p>With .NET Core 3.0, Microsoft shipped new <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/try-the-new-system-text-json-apis" class="ulink" target="_top">System.Text.Json APIs</a>
that are included in-the-box with current versions of .NET. We have adopted
<code class="literal">System.Text.Json</code> for all serialization. Consumers can still define and register
their own <code class="literal">Serializer</code> implementation for their document types should they prefer
to use a different serialization library.</p>
<p>By adopting <code class="literal">System.Text.Json</code>, we now depend on a well-maintained and supported
library from Microsoft. <code class="literal">System.Text.Json</code> is designed from the ground up to support
the latest performance optimizations in .NET and, as a result, provides both fast and low-allocation serialization.</p>
<h3><a id="_mockability_of_elasticsearchclient"></a>Mockability of ElasticsearchClient<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Testing code is an important part of software development. We recommend
that consumers prefer introducing an abstraction for their use of the Elasticsearch .NET Client
as the prefered way to decouple consuming code from client types and support unit
testing.</p>
<p>In order to support user testing scenarios, we have unsealed the <code class="literal">ElasticsearchClient</code>
type and made its methods virtual. This supports mocking the type directly for unit
testing. This is an improvement over the original <code class="literal">IElasticClient</code> interface from
<code class="literal">NEST</code> (v7) which only supported mocking of top-level client methods.</p>
<p>We have also introduced a <code class="literal">TestableResponseFactory</code> in <code class="literal">Elastic.Transport</code> to
make it easier to create response instances with specific status codes and validity
that can be used during unit testing.</p>
<p>These changes are in addition to our existing support for testing with an
<code class="literal">InMemoryConnection</code>, virtualized clusters and with our
<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net-abstractions/blob/master/src/Elastic.Elasticsearch.Managed" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">Elastic.Elasticsearch.Managed</code></a> library for integration
testing against real Elasticsearch instances. We will introduce more documentation on testing methodologies in the near future.</p>
<h3><a id="_migrating_to_elastic_clients_elasticsearch"></a>Migrating to Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The 8.0.0 release does not currently have full-feature parity with <code class="literal">NEST</code>. The
client primary use case is for application developers communitating with Elasticsearch.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The 8.0.0 release focuses on core endpoints, more specifically for common CRUD
scenarios. We intend to reduce the feature gap in subsequent versions. We anticipate
that this initial release will best suit new applications and may not yet be migration-ready for all existing consumers. We recommend reviewing this documentation carefully to learn about the missing features and reduced API surface details before migrating from the v7 <code class="literal">NEST</code> client.</p>
<p>The choice to code-generate a new evolution of the Elasticsearch .NET Client introduces some
significant breaking changes. We consciously took the opportunity to refactor
and reconsider historic design choices as part of this major release, intending
to limit future breaking changes.</p>
<p>The v8 client is shipped as a new <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch/" class="ulink" target="_top">NuGet package</a>
which can be installed alongside v7 <code class="literal">NEST</code>. We
anticipate that some consumers may prefer a phased migration with both
packages side-by-side for a short period of time to manage complex migrations. In addition, <code class="literal">NEST</code> 7.17.x can continue to be used in
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/net-api/7.17/connecting-to-elasticsearch-v8.html" class="ulink" target="_top">compatibility mode</a>
with Elasticsearch 8.x servers until the v8 Elasticsearch .NET Client features
align with application requirements.</p>
<p>We will continue to prioritize the feature roadmap and code-generation work
based on <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/issues" class="ulink" target="_top">feedback</a> from consumers who may rely on features that are initially unavailable.</p>
<h3><a id="_breaking_changes_8"></a>Breaking Changes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>As a result of code-generating a majority of the client types, this version of
the client includes multiple breaking changes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We have strived to keep the core foundation reasonably similar, but types emitted
through code-generation are subject to change between <code class="literal">NEST</code> (v7) and the new
<code class="literal">Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch</code> (v8) package.</p>
<h4><a id="_namespaces"></a>Namespaces<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>We have renamed the package and top-level namespace for the v8 client to
<code class="literal">Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch</code>. All types belong to this namespace. When
necessary, to avoid potential conflicts, types are generated into suitable
sub-namespaces based on the <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch specification</a>. Additional <code class="literal">using</code> directives may be required to access such types
when using the Elasticsearch .NET Client.</p>
<p>Transport layer concepts have moved to the new <code class="literal">Elastic.Transport</code> NuGet package
and related types are defined under its namespace. Some configuration and low-level transport functionality may require a <code class="literal">using</code> directive for the <code class="literal">Elastic.Transport</code>
namespace.</p>
<h4><a id="_type_names"></a>Type names<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Type names may have changed from previous versions. We are not listing these
explicitly due to the potentially vast number of subtle differences.
Type names will now more closely align to those used in the JSON and as documented
in the Elasticsearch documentation.</p>
<h4><a id="_class_members"></a>Class members<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Types may include renamed properties based on the Elasticsearch specification,
which differ from the original <code class="literal">NEST</code> property names. The types used for properties
may also have changed due to code-generation. If you identify missing or
incorrectly-typed properties, please open <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/issues/new/choose" class="ulink" target="_top">an issue</a> to alert us.</p>
<h4><a id="_sealing_classes"></a>Sealing classes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Opinions on "sealing by default" within the .NET ecosystem tend to be quite
polarized. Microsoft seal all internal types for potential performance gains
and we see a benefit in starting with that approach for the Elasticsearch .NET Client,
even for our public API surface.</p>
<p>While it prevents inheritance and, therefore, may inhibit a few consumer scenarios,
sealing by default is intended to avoid the unexpected or invalid
extension of types that could inadvertently be broken in the future. That said,
sealing is not necessarily a final choice for all types; but it is clearly
easier for a future release to unseal a previously-sealed class than
vice versa. We can therefore choose to unseal as valid scenarios arise,
should we determine that doing so is the best solution for those scenarios, such
as with mockability of the <code class="literal">ElasticsearchClient</code>. This goes back to our clean-slate concept for this new client.</p>
<h4><a id="_removed_features"></a>Removed features<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>As part of the clean-slate redesign of the new client, we have opted to remove
certain features from the v8.0 client. These are listed below:</p>
<h5><a id="_attribute_mappings"></a>Attribute mappings<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.9/docs/release-notes/release-notes-8.0.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>In previous versions of the <code class="literal">NEST</code> client, attributes could be used to configure
the mapping behaviour and inference for user types. We have removed support for
these attributes and recommend that mapping be completed via the fluent API when

<p>The <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cat.html" class="ulink" target="_top">CAT APIs</a>

<p>We have removed several interfaces that previously shipped as part of <code class="literal">NEST</code>. This
is a design decision to simplify the library and avoid interfaces where only a
single implementation of that interface is expected to exist, such as
<code class="literal">IElasticClient</code> in <code class="literal">NEST</code>. We have also switched to prefer abstract base classes
over interfaces across the library, as this allows us to add enhancements more
easily without introducing breaking changes for derived types.</p>

<p>While not an exhaustive list, the following are some of the main features which
have not been re-implemented for this initial 8.0.0 GA release.
These remain on our roadmap and will be reviewed and prioritized for inclusion in
future releases.</p>

<p>In this first release of the code-generated .NET client, we have specifically
focused on supporting commonly used endpoints. We have also skipped specific
queries and aggregations which need further work to generate code correctly.
Before migrating, please refer to the lists below for the endpoints,
queries and aggregations currently generated and available
in the 8.0.0 GA release to ensure that the features you are using are currently
supported.</p>
