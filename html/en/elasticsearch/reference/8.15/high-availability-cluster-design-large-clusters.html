<p>It&#8217;s not unusual for nodes to share common infrastructure, such as network
interconnects or a power supply. If so, you should plan for the failure of this
infrastructure and ensure that such a failure would not affect too many of your
nodes. It is common practice to group all the nodes sharing some infrastructure
into <em>zones</em> and to plan for the failure of any whole zone at once.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch expects node-to-node connections to be reliable, have low latency, and
have adequate bandwidth. Many Elasticsearch tasks require multiple round-trips between
nodes. A slow or unreliable interconnect may have a significant effect on the
performance and stability of your cluster.</p>
<p>For example, a few milliseconds of latency added to each round-trip can quickly
accumulate into a noticeable performance penalty. An unreliable network may
have frequent network partitions. Elasticsearch will automatically recover from a
network partition as quickly as it can but your cluster may be partly
unavailable during a partition and will need to spend time and resources to
resynchronize any missing data and rebalance itself once the partition heals.
Recovering from a failure may involve copying a large amount of data between
nodes so the recovery time is often determined by the available bandwidth.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve divided your cluster into zones, the network connections within each
zone are typically of higher quality than the connections between the zones.
Ensure the network connections between zones are of sufficiently high quality.
You will see the best results by locating all your zones within a single data
center with each zone having its own independent power supply and other
supporting infrastructure. You can also <em>stretch</em> your cluster across nearby
data centers as long as the network interconnection between each pair of data
centers is good enough.</p>
<p><a id="high-availability-cluster-design-min-network-perf"></a>There is no specific minimum network performance required to run a healthy Elasticsearch
cluster. In theory, a cluster will work correctly even if the round-trip
latency between nodes is several hundred milliseconds. In practice, if your
network is that slow then the cluster performance will be very poor. In
addition, slow networks are often unreliable enough to cause network partitions
that lead to periods of unavailability.</p>
<p>If you want your data to be available in multiple data centers that are further
apart or not well connected, deploy a separate cluster in each data center and
use <a class="xref" href="modules-cross-cluster-search.html" title="Search across clusters">cross-cluster search</a> or <a class="xref" href="xpack-ccr.html" title="Cross-cluster replication">cross-cluster replication</a> to link the
clusters together. These features are designed to perform well even if the
cluster-to-cluster connections are less reliable or performant than the network
within each cluster.</p>
<p>After losing a whole zone&#8217;s worth of nodes, a properly-designed cluster may be
functional but running with significantly reduced capacity. You may need
to provision extra nodes to restore acceptable performance in your
cluster when handling such a failure.</p>
<p>For resilience against whole-zone failures, it is important that there is a copy
of each shard in more than one zone, which can be achieved by placing data
nodes in multiple zones and configuring <a class="xref" href="modules-cluster.html#shard-allocation-awareness" title="Shard allocation awareness">shard allocation
awareness</a>. You should also ensure that client requests are sent to nodes in
more than one zone.</p>
<p>You should consider all node roles and ensure that each role is split
redundantly across two or more zones. For instance, if you are using
<a class="xref" href="ingest.html" title="Ingest pipelines">ingest pipelines</a> or machine learning, you should have ingest or machine learning nodes in two
or more zones. However, the placement of master-eligible nodes requires a little
more care because a resilient cluster needs at least two of the three
master-eligible nodes in order to function. The following sections explore the
options for placing master-eligible nodes across multiple zones.</p>
<div class="section">

</div></div></div>
<p>If you have two zones, you should have a different number of
master-eligible nodes in each zone so that the zone with more nodes will
contain a majority of them and will be able to survive the loss of the other
zone. For instance, if you have three master-eligible nodes then you may put
all of them in one zone or you may put two in one zone and the third in the
other zone. You should not place an equal number of master-eligible nodes in
each zone. If you place the same number of master-eligible nodes in each zone,
neither zone has a majority of its own. Therefore, the cluster may not survive
the loss of either zone.</p>

<h3 class="title"><a id="high-availability-cluster-design-two-zones-plus"></a>Two-zone clusters with a tiebreaker<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.15/docs/reference/high-availability/cluster-design.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
</div></div></div>
<p>The two-zone deployment described above is tolerant to the loss of one of its
zones but not to the loss of the other one because master elections are
majority-based. You cannot configure a two-zone cluster so that it can tolerate
the loss of <em>either</em> zone because this is theoretically impossible. You might
expect that if either zone fails then Elasticsearch can elect a node from the remaining
zone as the master but it is impossible to tell the difference between the
failure of a remote zone and a mere loss of connectivity between the zones. If
both zones were capable of running independent elections then a loss of
connectivity would lead to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain_(computing)" class="ulink" target="_top">split-brain problem</a> and
therefore data loss. Elasticsearch avoids this and protects your data by not electing
a node from either zone as master until that node can be sure that it has the
latest cluster state and that there is no other master in the cluster. This may
mean there is no master at all until connectivity is restored.</p>
<p>You can solve this by placing one master-eligible node in each of your two
zones and adding a single extra master-eligible node in an independent third
zone. The extra master-eligible node acts as a tiebreaker in cases
where the two original zones are disconnected from each other. The extra
tiebreaker node should be a <a class="xref" href="modules-node.html#voting-only-node" title="Voting-only master-eligible node">dedicated voting-only
master-eligible node</a>, also known as a dedicated tiebreaker. A dedicated
tiebreaker need not be as powerful as the other two nodes since it has no other
roles and will not perform any searches nor coordinate any client requests nor
be elected as the master of the cluster.</p>
<p>You should use <a class="xref" href="modules-cluster.html#shard-allocation-awareness" title="Shard allocation awareness">shard allocation awareness</a> to ensure
that there is a copy of each shard in each zone. This means either zone remains
fully available if the other zone fails.</p>
<p>All master-eligible nodes, including voting-only nodes, are on the critical
path for <a class="xref" href="cluster-state-publishing.html" title="Publishing the cluster state">publishing cluster state updates</a>. Cluster
state updates are usually independent of performance-critical workloads such as
indexing or searches, but they are involved in management activities such as
index creation and rollover, mapping updates, and recovery after a failure. The
performance characteristics of these activities are a function of the speed of
the storage on each master-eligible node, as well as the reliability and
latency of the network interconnections between all nodes in the cluster. You
must therefore ensure that the storage and networking available to the
nodes in your cluster are good enough to meet your performance goals.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>If you have three zones then you should have one master-eligible node in each
zone. If you have more than three zones then you should choose three of the
zones and put a master-eligible node in each of these three zones. This will
mean that the cluster can still elect a master even if one of the zones fails.</p>
<p>As always, your indices should have at least one replica in case a node fails,
unless they are <a class="xref" href="searchable-snapshots.html" title="Searchable snapshots">searchable snapshot indices</a>. You
should also use <a class="xref" href="modules-cluster.html#shard-allocation-awareness" title="Shard allocation awareness">shard allocation awareness</a> to limit
the number of copies of each shard in each zone. For instance, if you have an
index with one or two replicas configured then allocation awareness will ensure
that the replicas of the shard are in a different zone from the primary. This
means that a copy of every shard will still be available if one zone fails. The
availability of this shard will not be affected by such a failure.</p>
