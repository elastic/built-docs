<p>There may be situations where you want to repurpose a node without following
the <a class="xref" href="modules-node.html#change-node-role" title="Changing the role of a node">proper repurposing processes</a>. The <code class="literal">elasticsearch-node

<p>There may be situations where a node contains persistent cluster
settings that prevent the cluster from forming. Since the cluster cannot form,
it is not possible to remove these settings using the
<a class="xref" href="cluster-update-settings.html" title="Cluster update settings API">Cluster update settings</a> API.</p>

<h4><a id="_recovering_data_after_a_disaster"></a>Recovering data after a disaster<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.3/docs/reference/commands/node-tool.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes Elasticsearch nodes are temporarily stopped, perhaps because of the need to
perform some maintenance activity or perhaps because of a hardware failure.
After you resolve the temporary condition and restart the node,
it will rejoin the cluster and continue normally. Depending on your
configuration, your cluster may be able to remain completely available even
while one or more of its nodes are stopped.</p>
<p>Sometimes it might not be possible to restart a node after it has stopped. For
example, the node&#8217;s host may suffer from a hardware problem that cannot be
repaired. If the cluster is still available then you can start up a fresh node
on another host and Elasticsearch will bring this node into the cluster in place of the
failed node.</p>
<p>Each node stores its data in the data directories defined by the
<a class="xref" href="important-settings.html#path-settings" title="Path settings"><code class="literal">path.data</code> setting</a>. This means that in a disaster you can
also restart a node by moving its data directories to another host, presuming
that those data directories can be recovered from the faulty host.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch <a class="xref" href="modules-discovery-quorums.html" title="Quorum-based decision making">requires a response from a majority of the
master-eligible nodes</a> in order to elect a master and to update the cluster
state. This means that if you have three master-eligible nodes then the cluster
will remain available even if one of them has failed. However if two of the
three master-eligible nodes fail then the cluster will be unavailable until at
least one of them is restarted.</p>
<p>In very rare circumstances it may not be possible to restart enough nodes to
restore the cluster&#8217;s availability. If such a disaster occurs, you should
build a new cluster from a recent snapshot and re-import any data that was
ingested since that snapshot was taken.</p>
<p>However, if the disaster is serious enough then it may not be possible to
recover from a recent snapshot either. Unfortunately in this case there is no
way forward that does not risk data loss, but it may be possible to use the
<code class="literal">elasticsearch-node</code> tool to construct a new cluster that contains some of the
data from the failed cluster.</p>
<h4><a id="node-tool-override-version"></a>Bypassing version checks<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.3/docs/reference/commands/node-tool.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The data that Elasticsearch writes to disk is designed to be read by the current version
and a limited set of future versions. It cannot generally be read by older
versions, nor by versions that are more than one major version newer. The data
stored on disk includes the version of the node that wrote it, and Elasticsearch checks
that it is compatible with this version when starting up.</p>
<p>In rare circumstances it may be desirable to bypass this check and start up an
Elasticsearch node using data that was written by an incompatible version. This may not
work if the format of the stored data has changed, and it is a risky process
because it is possible for the format to change in ways that Elasticsearch may
misinterpret, silently leading to data loss.</p>
<p>To bypass this check, you can use the <code class="literal">elasticsearch-node override-version</code>
tool to overwrite the version number stored in the data path with the current
version, causing Elasticsearch to believe that it is compatible with the on-disk data.</p>
<h5><a id="node-tool-unsafe-bootstrap"></a>Unsafe cluster bootstrapping<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.3/docs/reference/commands/node-tool.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>If there is at least one remaining master-eligible node, but it is not possible
to restart a majority of them, then the <code class="literal">elasticsearch-node unsafe-bootstrap</code>
command will unsafely override the cluster&#8217;s <a class="xref" href="modules-discovery-voting.html" title="Voting configurations">voting
configuration</a> as if performing another
<a class="xref" href="modules-discovery-bootstrap-cluster.html" title="Bootstrapping a cluster">cluster bootstrapping process</a>.
The target node can then form a new cluster on its own by using
the cluster metadata held locally on the target node.</p>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>These steps can lead to arbitrary data loss since the target node may not hold the latest cluster
metadata, and this out-of-date metadata may make it impossible to use some or
all of the indices in the cluster.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Since unsafe bootstrapping forms a new cluster containing a single node, once
you have run it you must use the <a class="xref" href="node-tool.html#node-tool-detach-cluster" title="Detaching nodes from their cluster"><code class="literal">elasticsearch-node
detach-cluster</code> tool</a> to migrate any other surviving nodes from the failed
cluster into this new cluster.</p>
<p>When you run the <code class="literal">elasticsearch-node unsafe-bootstrap</code> tool it will analyse the
state of the node and ask for confirmation before taking any action. Before
asking for confirmation it reports the term and version of the cluster state on
the node on which it runs as follows:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-txt">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-txt">Current node cluster state (term, version) pair is (4, 12)</pre>
</div>
<p>If you have a choice of nodes on which to run this tool then you should choose
one with a term that is as large as possible. If there is more than one
node with the same term, pick the one with the largest version.
This information identifies the node with the freshest cluster state, which minimizes the
quantity of data that might be lost. For example, if the first node reports
<code class="literal">(4, 12)</code> and a second node reports <code class="literal">(5, 3)</code>, then the second node is preferred
since its term is larger. However if the second node reports <code class="literal">(3, 17)</code> then
the first node is preferred since its term is larger. If the second node
reports <code class="literal">(4, 10)</code> then it has the same term as the first node, but has a
smaller version, so the first node is preferred.</p>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Running this command can lead to arbitrary data loss. Only run this tool if you
understand and accept the possible consequences and have exhausted all other
possibilities for recovery of your cluster.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The sequence of operations for using this tool are as follows:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">

master-eligible nodes in the cluster, and they cannot be repaired or recovered

</li>
<li class="listitem">

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>When you run the tool it will make sure that the node that is being used to
bootstrap the cluster is not running. It is important that all other
master-eligible nodes are also stopped while this tool is running, but the tool
does not check this.</p>
<p>The message <code class="literal">Master node was successfully bootstrapped</code> does not mean that
there has been no data loss, it just means that tool was able to complete its
job.</p>
<h5><a id="node-tool-detach-cluster"></a>Detaching nodes from their cluster<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.3/docs/reference/commands/node-tool.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>It is unsafe for nodes to move between clusters, because different clusters
have completely different cluster metadata. There is no way to safely merge the
metadata from two clusters together.</p>
<p>To protect against inadvertently joining the wrong cluster, each cluster
creates a unique identifier, known as the <em>cluster UUID</em>, when it first starts
up. Every node records the UUID of its cluster and refuses to join a
cluster with a different UUID.</p>
<p>However, if a node&#8217;s cluster has permanently failed then it may be desirable to
try and move it into a new cluster. The <code class="literal">elasticsearch-node detach-cluster</code>
command lets you detach a node from its cluster by resetting its cluster UUID.
It can then join another cluster with a different UUID.</p>
<p>For example, after unsafe cluster bootstrapping you will need to detach all the
other surviving nodes from their old cluster so they can join the new,
unsafely-bootstrapped cluster.</p>
<p>Unsafe cluster bootstrapping is only possible if there is at least one
surviving master-eligible node. If there are no remaining master-eligible nodes
then the cluster metadata is completely lost. However, the individual data
nodes also contain a copy of the index metadata corresponding with their
shards. This sometimes allows a new cluster to import these shards as
<a class="xref" href="modules-gateway-dangling-indices.html" title="Dangling indices">dangling indices</a>. You can sometimes
recover some indices after the loss of all master-eligible nodes in a cluster
by creating a new cluster and then using the <code class="literal">elasticsearch-node
detach-cluster</code> command to move any surviving nodes into this new cluster.</p>
<p>There is a risk of data loss when importing a dangling index because data nodes
may not have the most recent copy of the index metadata and do not have any
information about <a class="xref" href="docs-replication.html" title="Reading and Writing documents">which shard copies are in-sync</a>. This
means that a stale shard copy may be selected to be the primary, and some of
the shards may be incompatible with the imported mapping.</p>
