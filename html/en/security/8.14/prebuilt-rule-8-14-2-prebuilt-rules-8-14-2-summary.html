Adversaries may add these rules to allow remote access to VPC instances from any location, increasing the attack surface and potentially exposing the instances to unauthorized access.</p></td>

This rule looks for the first time a specific user identity has programmatically retrieved a specific secret value from Secrets Manager using the <code class="literal">GetSecretValue</code> action. This rule assumes that AWS services such as Lambda functions and EC2 instances are setup with IAM role&#8217;s assigned that have the necessary permissions to access the secrets in Secrets Manager. An adversary with access to a compromised AWS service such as an EC2 instance, Lambda function, or other service would rely on the compromised service&#8217;s IAM role to access the secrets in Secrets Manager.</p></td>

<td align="left" valign="top"><p>This rule monitors the creation of shared object files by previously unknown processes.
