<p>Distributed tracing can generate a substantial amount of data.
More data can mean higher costs and more noise.
Sampling aims to lower the amount of data ingested and the effort required to analyze that data&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all while still making it easy to find anomalous patterns in your applications, detect outages, track errors,
and lower mean time to recovery (MTTR).</p>
<p>Elastic APM supports two types of sampling:</p>

<p>In head-based sampling, the sampling decision for each trace is made when the trace is initiated.
Each trace has a defined and equal probability of being sampled.</p>
<p>For example, a sampling value of <code class="literal">.2</code> indicates a transaction sample rate of <code class="literal">20%</code>.
This means that only <code class="literal">20%</code> of traces will send and retain all of their associated information.
The remaining traces will drop contextual information to reduce the transfer and storage size of the trace.</p>
<p>Head-based sampling is quick and easy to set up.
Its downside is that it&#8217;s entirely random&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;interesting
data might be discarded purely due to chance.</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="configure-head-based-sampling.html" title="Configure head-based sampling">Configure head-based sampling</a> to get started.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Distributed tracing with head-based sampling</strong></span></p>
<p>In a distributed trace, the sampling decision is still made when the trace is initiated.
Each subsequent service respects the initial service&#8217;s sampling decision, regardless of its configured sample rate;
the result is a sampling percentage that matches the initiating service.</p>
<p>In this example, <code class="literal">Service A</code> initiates four transactions and has sample rate of <code class="literal">.5</code> (<code class="literal">50%</code>).
The sample rates of <code class="literal">Service B</code> and <code class="literal">Service C</code> are ignored.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In this example, <code class="literal">Service A</code> initiates four transactions and has a sample rate of <code class="literal">1</code> (<code class="literal">100%</code>).
Again, the sample rates of <code class="literal">Service B</code> and <code class="literal">Service C</code> are ignored.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>OpenTelemetry with head-based sampling</strong></span></p>
<p>Head-based sampling is implemented in the APM agents and SDKs, and
requires the sample rate to be propagated between services and the APM Server.
This functionality is not currently supported by OpenTelemetry,
which results in inaccurate APM throughput, latency, and error metrics.
OpenTelemetry users should consider using tail-based sampling instead.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="tail-based-sampling"></a>Tail-based sampling</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.7/docs/en/apm-server/sampling.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>In tail-based sampling, the sampling decision for each trace is made after the trace has completed.
This means all traces will be analyzed against a set of rules, or policies, which will determine the rate at which they are sampled.</p>
<p>Unlike head-based sampling, each trace does not have an equal probability of being sampled.
Because slower traces are more interesting than faster ones, tail-based sampling uses weighted random sampling&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;so
traces with a longer root transaction duration are more likely to be sampled than traces with a fast root transaction duration.</p>
<p>A downside of tail-based sampling is that it results in more data being sent from APM agents to the APM Server.
The APM Server will therefore use more CPU, memory, and disk than with head-based sampling.
However, because the tail-based sampling decision happens in APM Server, there is less data to transfer from APM Server to Elasticsearch.
So running APM Server close to your instrumented services can reduce any increase in transfer costs that tail-based sampling brings.</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="configure-tail-based-sampling.html" title="Configure tail-based sampling">Configure tail-based sampling</a> to get started.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Distributed tracing with tail-based sampling</strong></span></p>
<p>With tail-based sampling, all traces are observed and a sampling decision is only made once a trace completes.</p>
<p>In this example, <code class="literal">Service A</code> initiates four transactions.
If our sample rate is <code class="literal">.5</code> (<code class="literal">50%</code>) for traces with a <code class="literal">success</code> outcome,
and <code class="literal">1</code> (<code class="literal">100%</code>) for traces with a <code class="literal">failure</code> outcome,
the sampled traces would look something like this:</p>

<img src="./images/dt-sampling-example-3.png" alt="Distributed tracing and tail based sampling example one">
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>OpenTelemetry with tail-based sampling</strong></span></p>
<p>Tail-based sampling is implemented entirely in APM Server,
and will work with traces sent by either Elastic APM agents or OpenTelemetry SDKs.</p>

<p>A sampled trace retains all data associated with it.
A non-sampled trace drops all <a class="xref" href="data-model-spans.html" title="Spans">span</a> and <a class="xref" href="data-model-transactions.html" title="Transactions">transaction</a> data<sup>1</sup>.
Regardless of the sampling decision, all traces retain <a class="xref" href="data-model-errors.html" title="Errors">error</a> data.</p>
<p>Some visualizations in the APM app, like latency, are powered by aggregated transaction and span <a class="xref" href="data-model-metrics.html" title="Metrics">metrics</a>.
Metrics are based on sampled traces and weighted by the inverse sampling rate.
For example, if you sample at 5%, each trace is counted as 20.
As a result, as the variance of latency increases, or the sampling rate decreases, your level of error will increase.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Real User Monitoring (RUM) traces are an exception to this rule.
The Kibana apps that utilize RUM data depend on transaction events,
so non-sampled RUM traces retain transaction data&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;only span data is dropped.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="_sample_rates"></a>Sample rates</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.7/docs/en/apm-server/sampling.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>What&#8217;s the best sampling rate? Unfortunately, there isn&#8217;t one.
Sampling is dependent on your data, the throughput of your application, data retention policies, and other factors.
A sampling rate from <code class="literal">.1%</code> to <code class="literal">100%</code> would all be considered normal.
You&#8217;ll likely decide on a unique sample rate for different scenarios.
Here are some examples:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Services with considerably more traffic than others might be safe to sample at lower rates
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Routes that are more important than others might be sampled at higher rates
</li>
<li class="listitem">
A production service environment might warrant a higher sampling rate than a development environment
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Failed trace outcomes might be more interesting than successful traces&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;thus requiring a higher sample rate
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Regardless of the above, cost conscious customers are likely to be fine with a lower sample rate.</p>
