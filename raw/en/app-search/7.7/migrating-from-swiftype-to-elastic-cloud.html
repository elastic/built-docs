<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>App Search is now available on Elastic Cloud.</strong></span> Migrating from Swiftype.com to Elastic Cloud is possible today, and should be approached on an engine-by-engine basis. <a href="/blog/elastic-app-search-now-available-on-elasticsearch-service" class="ulink" target="_top">Learn more about App Search on Elastic Cloud&#8217;s Elasticsearch Service.</a></p>
<h4><a id="_sizing_your_app_search_on_elastic_cloud_deployment_storage"></a>Sizing your App Search on Elastic Cloud deployment storage</h4>
<p>There is a straightforward formula for determining your storage needs for Engines being migrated from Swiftype.com: multiply the <span class="strong strong"><strong>number of documents across all engines</strong></span> by 250kb. Migrations with less than 100,000 documents should be handled well by the default deployment. If you&#8217;re dealing with more than 100,000 documents, you may want to consider increasing your storage. Additionally, if you have analytics or log retention requirements, you&#8217;ll need to account for those when provisioning storage.</p>
<h4><a id="_important_differences_between_app_search_on_swiftype_com_and_app_search_on_elastic_cloud"></a>Important differences between App Search on Swiftype.com and App Search on Elastic Cloud</h4>
<p>Provisioning an App Search deployment on Elastic Cloud requires manual resource management. Notably:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
analytics and logging index sizes must be managed manually
</li>
<li class="listitem">
storage should be monitored closely during initial document ingestion
</li>
<li class="listitem">
CPU usage should be monitored closely once the new Engine is receiving production traffic

<h4><a id="_migrating_individual_engines_to_app_search_on_elastic_cloud"></a>Migrating individual Engines to App Search on Elastic Cloud</h4>
<p>For each Engine, you&#8217;ll be migrating Engine-level settings, adding the new Engine as an additional ingestion endpoint, backfilling documents, and then updating the query and ingestion clients to point to the new Engine.</p>
