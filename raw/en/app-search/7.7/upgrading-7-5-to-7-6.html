<p><em>How do I upgrade App Search to 7.6 from 7.5 on Cloud or when Self-Managing?</em></p>
<p>App Search releases new features and fixes at a regular cadence. That means you&#8217;ll want to upgrade!</p>
<p>Keeping your deployment up to date gives you access to new features, security updates, and performance improvements.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>This document focuses on the immediate upgrade from 7.5 to 7.6.</strong></span></p>
<p><em>For richer detail about the upgrade process, please read the <a class="xref" href="migrating-and-upgrading.html" title="Migrating &amp; Upgrading">Upgrade Guide</a>.</em></p>

<p>Before you begin it is helpful to do the following:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">

<p>There are two recommended upgrade paths. Whichever you choose will depend on your requirements for App Search service availability, on the capabilities of the platform you are using to manage the deployment, on available resources, and so. See the details below to better understand pros and cons of each upgrade path.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>If you are able to handle a downtime of the App Search service, then this is the most straight-forward upgrade path. We recommend this method to all customers who are able to schedule a maintenance window for their service or for non-mission-critical applications based on App Search.</p>

<p>For situations where App Search downtime is not acceptable or in cases where you want to ensure a rollback is possible&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;no matter what happens during an upgrade&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the safest way to perform the upgrade is through snapshot-based cloning of a deployment. The snapshot-based process is more involved, but it does guarantee data consistency and allows you to perform a migration without a downtime of the Search API</p>

<p>When deploying App Search on Elastic Cloud, you have access to two separate upgrade paths depending on your tolerance for App Search downtime:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The default upgrade path&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;via the Cloud Console&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;is performed in-place via a full cluster restart, meaning App Search will be unavailable for the duration of the upgrade. In future versions of App Search, this mode will allow for in-place upgrades via read-only mode, but as of 7.6.0 downtime is required.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If downtime is unacceptable for your use case, we recommend the <span class="strong strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="upgrading-7-5-to-7-6.html#app-search-upgrade-7-5-to-7-6-snapshot-upgrades" title="Snapshot-based Upgrade">Snapshot-based Upgrade</a></strong></span> process, that involves taking a snapshot of your deployment and then creating a new App Search deployment from the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/snapshot-restore.html" class="ulink" target="_top">snapshot</a> using a newer App Search version. <em>Please note: The snapshot-based upgrade process requires client-side changes to switch users to another deployment, but guarantees availability of the service during the upgrade process.

<p>If you are using Elastic Cloud or ECE versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.4, there is a known problem with App Search upgrades from versions 7.5 to 7.6&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<span class="strong strong"><strong>rolling upgrades could lead to limited data loss if you are actively modifying new engines during the upgrade process</strong></span>. As a workaround, before upgrading the 7.5 App Search instances to 7.6, you can stop the traffic towards those instances by clicking the <em>Stop routing</em> button in the UI. Once all 7.5 instances are no longer routing traffic, it is safe to perform the upgrade by clicking the <em>Upgrade</em> button.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>As with any software upgrades, there is always a chance that things will not go according to plan. This means you need to plan and prepare for the possibility of your App Search upgrade failing. You can review the comparison of different upgrade methods above and ensure you are comfortable with the risks associated with your preferred upgrade method before starting the upgrade process.</p>
<p>If you experience an upgrade failure, the information below should help you identify the causes of the issue and allow you to retry the upgrade if needed. App Search should be able to recover from many potential failures, meaning you should be able to retry an upgrade if it fails.</p>
<p>If your App Search upgrade fails, please do the following:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Check the App Search application logs of the new deployment&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<code class="literal">log/app-search.log</code> or <code class="literal">/var/log/app-search/app-search.log</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;to see the details of what happened.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If the upgrade failed due to an issue with Elasticsearch that you can fix, do that and then re-attempt the upgrade by starting a new App Search instance again.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If the process consistently fails, rollback using a method specific to your preferred upgrade path.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Capture the <code class="literal">app-search.log file</code> and file a support case with Elastic if you need further help troubleshooting the upgrade process.
