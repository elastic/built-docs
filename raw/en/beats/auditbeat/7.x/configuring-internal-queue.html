<p>Auditbeat uses an internal queue to store events before publishing them. The
queue is responsible for buffering and combining events into batches that can
be consumed by the outputs. The outputs will use bulk operations to send a
batch of events in one transaction.</p>
<p>You can configure the type and behavior of the internal queue by setting
options in the <code class="literal">queue</code> section of the <code class="literal">auditbeat.yml</code> config file. Only one
queue type can be configured.</p>
<p>This sample configuration sets the memory queue to buffer up to 4096 events:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">queue.mem:
  events: 4096</pre>
</div>
<h3><a id="configuration-internal-queue-memory"></a>Configure the memory queue<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.x/libbeat/docs/queueconfig.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The memory queue keeps all events in memory.</p>
<p>If no flush interval and no number of events to flush is configured,
all events published to this queue will be directly consumed by the outputs.
To enforce spooling in the queue, set the <code class="literal">flush.min_events</code> and <code class="literal">flush.timeout</code> options.</p>
<p>By default <code class="literal">flush.min_events</code> is set to 2048 and <code class="literal">flush.timeout</code> is set to 1s.</p>
<p>The output&#8217;s <code class="literal">bulk_max_size</code> setting limits the number of events being processed at once.</p>
<p>The memory queue waits for the output to acknowledge or drop events. If
the queue is full, no new events can be inserted into the memory queue. Only
after the signal from the output will the queue free up space for more events to be accepted.</p>
<p>This sample configuration forwards events to the output if 512 events are
available or the oldest available event has been waiting for 5s in the queue:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">queue.mem:
  events: 4096
  flush.min_events: 512
  flush.timeout: 5s</pre>

<p>Minimum number of events required for publishing. If this value is set to 0, the

the output has to wait for more events to become available.</p>
<p>The default value is 2048.</p>

</div>
<p>The disk queue stores pending events on the disk rather than main memory.
This allows Beats to queue a larger number of events than is possible with
the memory queue, and to save events when a Beat or device is restarted.
This increased reliability comes with a performance tradeoff, as every
incoming event must be written and read from the device&#8217;s disk. However,
for setups where the disk is not the main bottleneck, the disk queue gives
a simple and relatively low-overhead way to add a layer of robustness to
incoming event data.</p>
<p>The disk queue is expected to replace the file spool in a future release.</p>
<p>To enable the disk queue with default settings, specify a maximum size:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">queue.disk:
  max_size: 10GB</pre>
</div>
<p>The queue will use up to the specified maximum size on disk. It will only
use as much space as required. For example, if the queue is only storing
1GB of events, then it will only occupy 1GB on disk no matter how high the
maximum is. Queue data is deleted from disk after it has been successfully
sent to the output.</p>
<h4><a id="configuration-internal-queue-disk-reference"></a>Configuration options<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.x/libbeat/docs/queueconfig.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>You can specify the following options in the <code class="literal">queue.disk</code> section of the
<code class="literal">auditbeat.yml</code> config file:</p>
<h5><a id="_path"></a><code class="literal">path</code><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.x/libbeat/docs/queueconfig.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>The path to the directory where the disk queue should store its data files.
The directory is created on startup if it doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>The default value is <code class="literal">"${path.data}/diskqueue"</code>.</p>
<h5><a id="_max_size_required"></a><code class="literal">max_size</code> (required)<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.x/libbeat/docs/queueconfig.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>The maximum size the queue should use on disk. Events that exceed this
maximum will either pause their input or be discarded, depending on
the input&#8217;s configuration.</p>
<p>A value of <code class="literal">0</code> means that no maximum size is enforced, and the queue can
grow up to the amount of free space on the disk. This value should be used
with caution, as completely filling a system&#8217;s main disk can make it
inoperable. It is best to use this setting only with a dedicated data or
backup partition that will not interfere with Auditbeat or the rest
of the host system.</p>
<p>The default value is <code class="literal">10GB</code>.</p>
<h5><a id="_segment_size"></a><code class="literal">segment_size</code><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.x/libbeat/docs/queueconfig.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>Data added to the queue is stored in segment files. Each segment contains
some number of events waiting to be sent to the outputs, and is deleted when
all its events are sent. By default, segment size is limited to 1/10 of the
maximum queue size. Using a smaller size means that the queue will use more
data files, but they will be deleted more quickly after use. Using a larger
size means some data will take longer to delete, but the queue will use
fewer auxiliary files. It is usually fine to leave this value unchanged.</p>
<p>The default value is <code class="literal">max_size / 10</code>.</p>
<h5><a id="_read_ahead"></a><code class="literal">read_ahead</code><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.x/libbeat/docs/queueconfig.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>The number of events that should be read from disk into memory while
waiting for an output to request them. If you find outputs are slowing
down because they can&#8217;t read as many events at a time, adjusting this
setting upward may help, at the cost of higher memory usage.</p>
<p>The default value is <code class="literal">512</code>.</p>
<h5><a id="_write_ahead"></a><code class="literal">write_ahead</code><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.x/libbeat/docs/queueconfig.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>The number of events the queue should accept and store in memory while
waiting for them to be written to disk. If you find the queue&#8217;s memory
use is too high because events are waiting too long to be written to
disk, adjusting this setting downward may help, at the cost of reduced
event throughput. On the other hand, if inputs are waiting or discarding
events because they are being produced faster than the disk can handle,
adjusting this setting upward may help, at the cost of higher memory
usage.</p>
<p>The default value is <code class="literal">2048</code>.</p>
<h5><a id="_retry_interval"></a><code class="literal">retry_interval</code><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.x/libbeat/docs/queueconfig.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>Some disk errors may block operation of the queue, for example a permission
error writing to the data directory, or a disk full error while writing an
event. In this case, the queue reports the error and retries after pausing
for the time specified in <code class="literal">retry_interval</code>.</p>
<p>The default value is <code class="literal">1s</code> (one second).</p>
<h5><a id="_max_retry_interval"></a><code class="literal">max_retry_interval</code><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.x/libbeat/docs/queueconfig.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>When there are multiple consecutive errors writing to the disk, the queue
increases the retry interval by factors of 2 up to a maximum of
<code class="literal">max_retry_interval</code>. Increase this value if you are concerned about logging
too many errors or overloading the host system if the target disk becomes
unavailable for an extended time.</p>
<p>The default value is <code class="literal">30s</code> (thirty seconds).</p>

<p>The disk queue offers similar functionality to the file spool with a
streamlined configuration and lower overhead. It is expected to replace the
file spool in a future release. While the file spool is still included for
backward compatibility, new configurations should use the disk queue
when possible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The file spool queue stores all events in an on disk ring buffer. The spool
has a write buffer, which new events are written to. Events written to the
spool are forwarded to the outputs, only after the write buffer has been
flushed successfully.</p>
<p>The spool waits for the output to acknowledge or drop events. If the spool is
full, no new events can be inserted. The spool will block. Space is freed only
after a signal from the output has been received.</p>
<p>On disk, the spool divides a file into pages. The <code class="literal">file.page_size</code> setting
configures the file&#8217;s page size at file creation time. The optimal page size depends
on the effective block size, used by the underlying file system.</p>
<p>This sample configuration enables the spool with all default settings (See
<a class="xref" href="configuring-internal-queue.html#configuration-internal-queue-spool-reference" title="Configuration options">Configuration options</a> for defaults) and the
default file path:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">queue.spool: ~</pre>
</div>
<p>This sample configuration creates a spool of 512MiB, with 16KiB pages. The
write buffer is flushed if 10MiB of contents, or 1024 events have been
written. If the oldest available event has been waiting for 5s in the write
buffer, the buffer will be flushed as well:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">queue.spool:
  file:
    path: "${path.data}/spool.dat"
    size: 512MiB
    page_size: 16KiB
  write:
    buffer_size: 10MiB
    flush.timeout: 5s
    flush.events: 1024</pre>
