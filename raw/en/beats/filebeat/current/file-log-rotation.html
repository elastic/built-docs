<p>Filebeat supports reading from rotating log files. However, some log
rotation strategies can result in lost or duplicate events when using
Filebeat to forward messages. To resolve this issue:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Avoid log rotation strategies that copy and truncate log files</strong></span></p>
<p>Log rotation strategies that copy and truncate the input log file can result in
Filebeat sending duplicate events. This happens because Filebeat
identifies files by inode and device name. During log rotation, lines that
Filebeat has already processed are moved to a new file. When
Filebeat encounters the new file, it reads from the beginning because the
previous state information (the offset and read timestamp) is associated with the
inode and device name of the old file.</p>
<p>Furthermore, strategies that copy and truncate the input log file can result in
lost events if lines are written to the log file after it&#8217;s copied, but before
it&#8217;s truncated.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Make sure Filebeat is configured to read from all rotated logs</strong></span></p>
<p>When an input log file is moved or renamed during log rotation, Filebeat is
able to recognize that the file has already been read. After the file is
rotated, a new log file is created, and the application continues logging.
Filebeat picks up the new file during the next scan. Because the file
has a new inode and device name, Filebeat starts reading it from the
beginning.</p>
<p>To avoid missing events from a rotated file, configure the input to read from
the log file and all the rotated files. For examples, see
<a class="xref" href="file-log-rotation.html#log-rotate-example" title="Example configurations">Example configurations</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This section shows a typical configuration for logrotate, a popular tool for
doing log rotation on Linux, followed by a Filebeat configuration that
reads all the rotated logs.</p>

<p>In this example, Filebeat reads web server log. The logs are rotated every
day, and the new file is created with the specified permissions.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">

<p>In this example, Filebeat is configured to read all log files to make
sure it does not miss any events.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">filebeat.inputs:
- type: log

<p>On Windows, log rotation schemes that delete old files and rename newer
files to old filenames might get blocked if the old files are being processed by
Filebeat. This happens because Windows does not delete files and file
metadata until the last process has closed the file. Unlike most *nix
filesystems, a Windows filename cannot be reused until all processes accessing
the file have closed the deleted file.</p>
<p>To avoid this problem, use dates in rotated filenames. The file will never
be renamed to an older filename, and the log writer and log rotator will always
be able to open the file. This approach also highly reduces the chance of
log writing, rotation, and collection interfering with each other.</p>
<p>Because log rotation is typically handled by the logging application, we are
not providing an example configuration for Windows.</p>
