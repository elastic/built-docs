<p>Beats 5.0 comes with several backwards incompatible configuration changes.
However, we provide a script that can automatically fixup the most common
settings in your configuration files.</p>
<p>You can find this script in the Beats download packages. For the <code class="literal">.tar.gz</code> and
<code class="literal">.zip</code> archives, look under:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">./scripts/migrate_beat_config_1_x_to_5_0.py</pre>
</div>
<p>For the <code class="literal">.deb</code> and <code class="literal">.rpm</code> packages, look under the
<code class="literal">/usr/share/&lt;beatname&gt;/scripts/</code> folder, for example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">/usr/share/packetbeat/scripts/migrate_beat_config_1_x_to_5_0.py</pre>
</div>
<p>Python 2.7 or later is required for executing the migration script.</p>
<p>To upgrade your configuration file automatically, simply pass it as an argument
to the migration script, for example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">&gt; ./scripts/migrate_beat_config_1_x_to_5_0.py packetbeat.yml
Backup file created: packetbeat.yml.bak</pre>
</div>
<p>The script will automatically create a backup file and overwrite the input file
with the upgraded version. You can also use the <code class="literal">--dry</code> option, which doesn&#8217;t
modify the input file, but outputs the upgraded version to stdout instead.</p>

<p>Filebeat stores the read offset in a registry file that it persists to disk.
The format of this file has changed in version 5.0, but Filebeat automatically
upgrades the format on the first run, so there&#8217;s normally no action required on
upgrading.</p>
<p>If you have installed Filebeat from the DEB or RPM packages, the location of the
file stays the same as well (<code class="literal">/var/lib/filebeat/registry</code>). Also if you&#8217;ve
installed Filebeat as a service on Windows, the location stays the same
(<code class="literal">C:\ProgramData\filebeat\registry</code>).</p>
<p>If you are running Filebeat from the <code class="literal">tar.gz</code> archive, however, the location of
the registry file has changed. In version 1.x it was by default named
<code class="literal">.filebeat</code> in the current working directory. In version 5.0, it is
<code class="literal">data/registry</code> relative to the binary location. For upgrading in this case, we
recommend copying the <code class="literal">.filebeat</code> file to <code class="literal">data/registry</code>.</p>

<p>When upgrading to Metricbeat, keep in mind that any data you&#8217;ve collected
with Topbeat is not compatible with the 5.0 version of the Beats dashboards
because the underlying event data structures have changed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>With the Beats 5.0 release, Topbeat is replaced by Metricbeat, which offers more
functionality. More precisely, the Topbeat functionality is roughly equivalent
to the "system" module in Metricbeat.</p>
<p>While there is no automatic way to convert a Topbeat configuration file to the
equivalent of a Metricbeat configuration file, both configurations are simple
enough that migrating shouldn&#8217;t take long.</p>
<p>For example, this is the input section of the Topbeat configuration file:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">input:
  # In seconds, defines how often to read server statistics
  period: 10

  # Regular expression to match the processes that are monitored
  # By default, all the processes are monitored
  procs: [".*"]

  # Statistics to collect (all enabled by default)
  stats:
    # per system statistics, by default is true
    system: true

    # per process statistics, by default is true
    process: true

    # file system information, by default is true
    filesystem: true

    # cpu usage per core, by default is false
    cpu_per_core: false</pre>
</div>
<p>And here is the equivalent configuration for the system module in Metricbeat:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">metricbeat.modules:

#------------------------------- System Module -------------------------------
- module: system
  metricsets:
    # CPU stats
    - cpu

    # System Load stats
    - load

    # Per filesystem stats
    - filesystem

    # Memory stats
    - memory

    # Network stats
    - network

    # Per process stats
    - process
  enabled: true
  period: 10s
  processes: ['.*']</pre>
</div>
<p>The remaining configuration options (outputs, name, tags) stay the same or can
be upgraded using the migration script.</p>
