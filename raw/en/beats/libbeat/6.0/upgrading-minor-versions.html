<p>As a general rule, upgrading between minor versions (e.g. 6.x to 6.y, where x &lt;
y) can be done by simply installing the new release and restarting the Beat
process, because the Beats keep backwards compatibility when it comes to
configuration and exported fields. Please review the <a class="xref" href="release-notes.html" title="Release notes">release
notes</a> for potential exceptions.</p>
<p>Upgrading between non-consecutive major versions (e.g. 1.x to 6.x) is not
supported. If you are on version 1.x of the Beats, we recommend first upgrading
to 5.6.</p>
