<p>There are two main ways of deploying Packetbeat:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
On dedicated servers, getting the traffic from mirror ports or tap devices.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
On your existing application servers.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The first option has the big advantage that there is no overhead of any kind on
your application servers. But it requires dedicated networking gear, which is
generally not available on cloud setups.</p>
<p>In both cases, the sniffing performance (reading packets passively from the network)
is very important. In the case of a dedicated server, better
sniffing performance means that less hardware is required. When Packetbeat is installed
on an existing application server, better sniffing performance means less overhead.</p>
<p>Currently Packetbeat has several options for traffic capturing:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">pcap</code>, which uses the libpcap library and works on most platforms, but
it&#8217;s not the fastest option.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">af_packet</code>, which uses memory mapped sniffing. This option is faster than libpcap
and doesn&#8217;t require a kernel module, but it&#8217;s Linux-specific.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The <code class="literal">af_packet</code> option, also known as "memory-mapped sniffing," makes use of a
Linux-specific
<a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/networking/packet_mmap.txt" class="ulink" target="_top">feature</a>.
This could be the optimal sniffing mode for both the dedicated server and
when Packetbeat is deployed on an existing application server.</p>
<p>The way it works is that both the kernel and the user space program map the
same memory zone, and a simple circular buffer is organized in this memory zone.
The kernel writes packets into the circular buffer, and the user space program
reads from it. The poll system call is used for getting a notification for the
first packet available, but the remaining available packets can be simply read
via memory access.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">af_packet</code> sniffer can be further tuned to use more memory in exchange for
better performance. The larger the size of the circular buffer, the fewer
system calls are needed, which means that fewer CPU cycles are consumed. The default size
of the buffer is 30 MB, but you can increase it like this:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">packetbeat.interfaces.device: eth0
packetbeat.interfaces.type: af_packet
packetbeat.interfaces.buffer_size_mb: 100</pre>
</div>

<p>You can specify the following options in the <code class="literal">packetbeat.interfaces</code> section
of the <code class="literal">packetbeat.yml</code> config file. Here is an example configuration:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">packetbeat.interfaces.device: any
packetbeat.interfaces.snaplen: 1514
packetbeat.interfaces.type: af_packet
packetbeat.interfaces.buffer_size_mb: 100</pre>
</div>
<h4><a id="_device"></a><code class="literal">device</code><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.4/packetbeat/docs/packetbeat-options.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The network device to capture traffic from. The specified device is set automatically to promiscuous mode,
meaning that Packetbeat can capture traffic from other hosts on the same LAN.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">packetbeat.interfaces.device: eth0</pre>
</div>
<p>On Linux, you can specify <code class="literal">any</code> for the device, and Packetbeat captures all
messages sent or received by the server where Packetbeat is installed.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>When you specify <code class="literal">any</code> for the device, the interfaces are not set
      to promiscuous mode.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="literal">device</code> option also accepts specifying the device by its index in the list of
devices available for sniffing. To obtain the list of available devices,
run Packetbeat with the following command:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sh">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sh">packetbeat devices</pre>
</div>
<p>This command returns a list that looks something like the following:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sh">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sh">0: en0 (No description available)
1: awdl0 (No description available)
2: bridge0 (No description available)
3: fw0 (No description available)
4: en1 (No description available)
5: en2 (No description available)
6: p2p0 (No description available)
7: en4 (No description available)
8: lo0 (No description available)</pre>
</div>
<p>The following example sets up sniffing on the
first interface in the list:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">packetbeat.interfaces.device: 0</pre>
</div>
<p>Specifying the index is especially useful on Windows where device names can be long.</p>
<h4><a id="_snaplen"></a><code class="literal">snaplen</code><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.4/packetbeat/docs/packetbeat-options.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The maximum size of the packets to capture. The
default is 65535, which is large enough for almost all networks and interface
types. If you sniff on a physical network interface, the optimal setting is
the MTU size. On virtual interfaces, however, it&#8217;s safer to accept the default value.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">packetbeat.interfaces.device: eth0
packetbeat.interfaces.snaplen: 1514</pre>
</div>
<h4><a id="_type"></a><code class="literal">type</code><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.4/packetbeat/docs/packetbeat-options.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Packetbeat supports these sniffer types:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">pcap</code>, which uses the libpcap library and works on most platforms, but
it&#8217;s not the fastest option.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">af_packet</code>, which uses memory-mapped sniffing. This option is faster than libpcap
and doesn&#8217;t require a kernel module, but it&#8217;s Linux-specific.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The default sniffer type is <code class="literal">pcap</code>.</p>
<p>Here is an example configuration that specifies
the <code class="literal">af_packet</code> sniffing type:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">packetbeat.interfaces.device: eth0
packetbeat.interfaces.type: af_packet</pre>
</div>
<p>On Linux, if you are trying to optimize the CPU usage of Packetbeat, we
recommend trying the <code class="literal">af_packet</code> option.</p>
<p>If you use the <code class="literal">af_packet</code> sniffer, you can tune its behaviour by specifying the
following options:</p>
<h4><a id="_buffer_size_mb"></a><code class="literal">buffer_size_mb</code><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.4/packetbeat/docs/packetbeat-options.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The maximum size of the shared memory buffer to use
between the kernel and user space. A bigger buffer usually results in lower CPU
usage, but consumes more memory. This setting is only available for the
<code class="literal">af_packet</code> sniffer type. The default is 30 MB.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">packetbeat.interfaces.device: eth0
packetbeat.interfaces.type: af_packet
packetbeat.interfaces.buffer_size_mb: 100</pre>
</div>
<h4><a id="_with_vlans"></a><code class="literal">with_vlans</code><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.4/packetbeat/docs/packetbeat-options.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Packetbeat automatically generates a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter" class="ulink" target="_top">BPF</a> for capturing only
the traffic on ports where it expects to find known protocols.
For example, if you have configured port 80 for HTTP and port 3306 for MySQL,
Packetbeat generates the following BPF filter: <code class="literal">"port 80 or port 3306"</code>.</p>
<p>However, if the traffic contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q" class="ulink" target="_top">VLAN</a>
tags, the filter that Packetbeat generates is ineffective because the
offset is moved by four bytes. To fix this, you can enable the <code class="literal">with_vlans</code> option, which
generates a BPF filter that looks like this: <code class="literal">"port 80 or port 3306 or (vlan and (port 80 or port 3306))"</code>.</p>
<h4><a id="_bpf_filter"></a><code class="literal">bpf_filter</code><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.4/packetbeat/docs/packetbeat-options.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>

Packetbeat generates the following BPF filter: <code class="literal">"port 80 or port 3306"</code>.</p>
<p>You can use the <code class="literal">bpf_filter</code> setting to overwrite the generated BPF filter. For example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">packetbeat.interfaces.device: eth0
packetbeat.interfaces.bpf_filter: "net 192.168.238.0/0 and port 80 or port 3306"</pre>
</div>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>This setting disables automatic generation of the BPF filter. If
you use this setting, it&#8217;s your responsibility to keep the BPF filters in sync with the
ports defined in the <code class="literal">protocols</code> section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4><a id="_ignore_outgoing"></a><code class="literal">ignore_outgoing</code><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/edit/7.4/packetbeat/docs/packetbeat-options.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>If the <code class="literal">ignore_outgoing</code> option is enabled, Packetbeat ignores all the
transactions initiated from the server running Packetbeat.</p>
<p>This is useful when two Packetbeat instances publish the same transactions. Because one Packetbeat
sees the transaction in its outgoing queue and the other sees it in its incoming
queue, you can end up with duplicate transactions. To remove the duplicates, you
can enable the <code class="literal">packetbeat.ignore_outgoing</code> option on one of the servers.</p>
<p>For example, in the following scenario, you see a 3-server architecture
where a Beat is installed on each server. t1 is the transaction exchanged between
Server1 and Server2, and t2 is the transaction between Server2 and Server3.</p>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="./images/option_ignore_outgoing.png" alt="Beats Architecture">
</div>
</div>
<p>By default, each transaction is indexed twice because Beat2
sees both transactions. So you would see the following published transactions
(when <code class="literal">ignore_outgoing</code> is false):</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Beat1: t1
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Beat2: t1 and t2
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Beat3: t2
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To avoid duplicates, you can force your Beats to send only the incoming
transactions and ignore the transactions created by the local server. So you would
see the following published transactions (when <code class="literal">ignore_outgoing</code> is true):</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Beat1: none
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Beat2: t1
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Beat3: t2
</li>
</ul>
