<p>Beats are lightweight data shippers that you install as agents on your servers to send specific types of operational
data to Elasticsearch. Beats have a small footprint and use fewer system resources than Logstash.</p>
<p>Logstash has a larger footprint, but provides a broad array of input, filter, and output plugins for collecting, enriching,
and transforming data from a variety of sources.</p>
