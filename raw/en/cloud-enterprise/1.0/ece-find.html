<p>When you installed Elastic Cloud Enterprise and <a class="xref" href="ece-provisioning.html#ece-login" title="Log into the Cloud UI">logged into the Cloud UI</a> for the first time, you were greeted by a single cluster. We&#8217;ve also shown you how to <a class="xref" href="ece-provisioning.html#ece-create-cluster" title="Create Your First Cluster">create your own first cluster</a>, but that still only makes two clusters. What if you had hundreds of clusters to look after or maybe even a thousand? How would you find clusters that need your attention?</p>
<p>The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Clusters</strong></span> page in the Cloud UI provides several ways to find clusters that might need your attention, whether that&#8217;s clusters that have a problem or clusters that are at a specific version level or really almost anything you might want to find on a complex production system:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Check the visual health indicators of clusters in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Status</strong></span> column:</p>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ece-status.png" alt="Health status indicators">
</div>
</div>
<p>It looks like the <code class="literal">My First Cluster</code> has an issue that might need your attention, as it seems the last configuration change has failed.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Search for almost anything in the search text box:</p>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ece-search.png" alt="Search for clusters">
</div>
</div>
<p>Here, searching for the keyword <code class="literal">Cluster</code> returns all clusters in the system, including both Elasticsearch and Kibana clusters. And there it is again, our <code class="literal">My First Cluster</code> with a problem.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Add filters to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Clusters</strong></span> view to filter for specific conditions:</p>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ece-filter.png" alt="Add a filter">
</div>
</div>
<p>Looking for all clusters of a specific version, because you want to upgrade them? Easy. Or what about that cluster you noticed before lunch that seemed to be spending an awfully long time changing its configuration&#8212;&#8203;is it done? Just add a filter to find any ongoing configuration changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
