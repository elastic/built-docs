<p>The following limitations and known problems apply to the 1.0.2 release of Elastic Cloud Enterprise:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
When you install Elastic Cloud Enterprise on a new host and assign it the allocator role from the command line with the <code class="literal">--roles "allocator"</code> parameter during installation, new clusters might not get created on the allocator. To resolve this issue, see <a class="xref" href="ece-issues.html#ece-issues-allocator-usage" title="Allocators Not Being Used">Allocators Are Not Being Used</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
On RHEL and CentOS, the firewalld service is not compatible with Docker and interferes with the installation of ECE. You must disable firewalld before installing or reinstalling ECE.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Pending plan changes for your cluster in the Cloud UI that would exceed available capacity will fail as expected but might then require you to manually recover from the failure. (To recover, locate the details for the plan attempt and copy the diff; manually edit the diff to revert to the original plan and apply the modified plan into the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Advanced cluster configuration</strong></span> panel.)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
X-Pack monitoring features and Marvel can be used only to send monitoring data between Elasticsearch clusters that are running the same version.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you install Elastic Cloud Enterprise on AWS, you likely need to <a class="xref" href="ece-issues.html#ece-aws-private-ip" title="Cloud UI, Elasticsearch, and Kibana Endpoint URLs Inaccessible on AWS">modify the cluster endpoint</a>, as the public hostname resolves to a different IP address externally than it does internally on the cluster.

</ul>

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Changing the generated password for the <code class="literal">admin</code> user on the administration console cluster that backs the Cloud UI is not supported. This is the <code class="literal">admin</code> user on the <code class="literal">admin-console-elasticsearch</code> cluster that gets created during the Elastic Cloud Enterprise installation.</p>
<div class="warning admon">
