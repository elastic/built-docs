<p>Now that you have installed Elastic Cloud Enterprise on your first host and on any additional hosts you want to use, you are ready to provision your first cluster in the Cloud UI.</p>
<h3><a id="ece-login"></a>Log into the Cloud UI<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/1.1/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-provisioning.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You can access the Cloud UI over either HTTP or HTTPS. Secure access through the HTTPS protocol is available with certificates generated during the installation of Elastic Cloud Enterprise, but will prompt you with a warning in your browser. If your organization provides them, <a class="xref" href="ece-manage-certificates.html" title="Manage Security Certificates">add your own TLS/SSL security certificates</a> to avoid receiving a warning in your browser in the future.</p>
<p>To access the Cloud UI in a web browser:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Connect to one of the URLs provided at the end of the installation process on your first host, replacing <code class="literal">FIRST_HOST</code> with the correct IP address or DNS hostname. Use the credentials provided with the URLs to log in.</p>

<p>You can use either the <code class="literal">root</code> user or the <code class="literal">readonly</code> user to log in, but only the <code class="literal">root</code> user has the required privileges to make changes to any resources in the Cloud UI. If you are logging into the Cloud UI for the first time, use the <code class="literal">root</code> user.</p>

<p>The Cloud UI front page displays the available clusters and some important information about them, such as cluster health status, the Elasticsearch version used, the number of nodes in the cluster, and node capacity:</p>

<p>The <code class="literal">logging-and-metrics</code> cluster is for use by your ECE installation only.

<p>We&#8217;ll explore more aspects of the Cloud UI soon, but for now, go ahead and create your first Elasticsearch cluster.</p>

<p>An Elasticsearch cluster consists of one or more nodes that are working together to share their data and workload. A cluster can provisioned with as many nodes as the available resources can support, as long as there is at least one allocator with some spare capacity.</p>
<p>To create your first cluster:</p>

<a class="xref" href="ece-provisioning.html#ece-login" title="Log into the Cloud UI">Log into the Cloud UI</a>, if you aren&#8217;t logged in already.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
On the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Clusters</strong></span> page, click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Create cluster</strong></span>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Specify how you want your Elasticsearch cluster to be configured, including:</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Don&#8217;t want to work through all of these options for your first cluster? Give your cluster a name, select the Elasticsearch version, the level of fault tolerance, and node capacity. Click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Create cluster</strong></span> and you&#8217;re done.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Cluster name
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Specifies a name for your cluster. If left blank, a cluster ID is generated.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Fault tolerance
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Selects the level of fault tolerance. On a production system, create a cluster with at least two availability zones, three for mission-critical deployments. If you installed Elastic Cloud Enterprise on only a single host, you will only be able to specify single-zone deployments without fault tolerance. This is fine for a first test cluster, but not recommended for production systems. If you do not see an option for two or three availability zones, you might need to need to <a class="xref" href="ece-add-capacity.html" title="Scale Out Your Installation">add some capacity</a> first.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Node capacity
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Specifies the amount of memory and storage assigned to each node, in a fixed ratio. The cluster size you use depends on how much data you have and what queries you plan to run, but you can always <a class="xref" href="ece-resize-cluster.html" title="Resize Your Cluster">resize your cluster</a> later on. Currently, half of the memory is assigned to the JVM heap. For example, on a cluster with 32 GB RAM, 16 GB are allotted to heap.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Node Count
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Specifies the number of nodes to provision in each availability zone. Adding more nodes lets you scale out horizontally by adding more processing capacity to your cluster.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Dedicated master-eligible nodes
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
When you create a cluster, you can also specify to use dedicated <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-node.html#master-node" class="ulink" target="_top">master-eligible nodes</a>, one per availability zone. These master nodes are responsible for lightweight cluster-wide actions such as creating or deleting an index, tracking which nodes are part of the cluster, and deciding which shards to allocate to which nodes. By default, each node is a master-eligible node and a data node. In larger clusters, such as production clusters, it&#8217;s a good practice to split the roles. Creating dedicated master nodes ensures that your master node is stable and not handling search or indexing work.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Snapshot repository
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Specifies a repository where snapshots are stored. To be able to select a repository, you must <a class="xref" href="ece-manage-repositories.html" title="Manage Snapshot Repositories">add a snapshot configuration</a> first. When a repository is specified, a snapshot is taken every 30 minutes or at the interval you specify through your user settings. A snapshot repository is not required to create a cluster, but without one your your data will not be backed up. You can also <a class="xref" href="ece-manage-repositories.html#ece-manage-repositories-clusters" title="Manage Elasticsearch Cluster Repositories">update the cluster to use a snapshot repository</a> later on.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Elasticsearch version
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Selects the version of Elasticsearch to deploy. Elasticsearch versions are denoted as <code class="literal">X.Y.Z</code>, where <code class="literal">X</code> is the major version, <code class="literal">Y</code> is the minor version, and <code class="literal">Z</code> is the patch level or maintenance release. You can upgrade Elasticsearch versions for an existing cluster later on.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Plugins
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Lists the official plugins available for the selected Elasticsearch version that you can add. Plugins you add from this list have been tested to work with your version of Elasticsearch and are upgraded for you whenever you upgrade your version of Elasticsearch.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Scripting
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Restricts how Elasticsearch can run scripts. Script are useful for implementing additional features, such as flexible ranking, filtering, faceting, and more. It is important to restrict how scripts run, as scripts can enable arbitrary code execution.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Default number of shards
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Sets the number of primary shards that an index should have. The default is 1. Before you change the number of shards, take a look at <a href="/blog/found-sizing-elasticsearch/" class="ulink" target="_top">Sizing Elasticsearch</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Automatic index creation
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Enables or disables automatic index creation, if you index a document to an index that does not exist.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Deletion requires name
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Enables requiring an explicit name or allows wildcards for destructive actions like deleting an index.
