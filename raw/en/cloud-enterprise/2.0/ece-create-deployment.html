<p>Deploy Elasticsearch, Kibana and other products or features of the Elastic Stack quickly by picking one of our tried-and-true templates. Templates pre-select initial hardware configurations that you can deploy as-is, or customize further to match your use case. <a class="xref" href="ece-getting-started-templates.html" title="What Are Deployment Templates?">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a></p>
<p>To get up and running with your deployment quickly:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
From the Cloud UI, click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Create deployment</strong></span>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Pick your Elastic Stack version and give your deployment a name.

<p>Optimize your deployment for your use case by selecting a deployment template. To learn more about how optimizing your deployment works, see <a class="xref" href="ece-getting-started-templates.html" title="What Are Deployment Templates?">What Are Deployment Templates?</a></p>
<p>Elastic Cloud Enterprise includes the following deployment templates:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Default
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A template to get you started and for backwards compatibility with existing deployments. The default template is suitable for search and general all-purpose workloads that don&#8217;t require more specialized resources. <a class="xref" href="ece-getting-started-templates-default.html" title="Default Template">What&#8217;s included &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Hot - Warm Architecture
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Use for time-series analytics and logging workloads that benefit from automatic index curation. <a class="xref" href="ece-getting-started-templates-hot-warm.html" title="Hot-Warm Architecture Template">What&#8217;s included &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>To use this template effectively, you must tag your allocators, so that ECE knows where to send hot and warm data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>After a deployment is spun up, you can scale the size and add other features; however, the instance configuration and computing ratios cannot be changed. If you need to change an existing deployment to another template, we recommend <a class="xref" href="ece-migrate-data.html" title="Migrating Your Elasticsearch Data">migrating your data</a>.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Enable additional features, such as:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Machine learning (ML)
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Detect anomalies with data modeling to find trends, periodicity, and more. <a href="/guide/en/x-pack/6.2/xpack-ml.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>.

<p>Optional: Restore an Elasticsearch snapshot from another deployment.</p>
<p>Restoring a snapshot can help with major version upgrades by creating a separate, non-production deployment where you can test, for example. Or, make life easier for your developers by providing them with a development environment that is populated with real data.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>At this point, you can:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Create deployment</strong></span> to get started right away. Recommended if you are a trial user or new to the Elastic Stack.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Customize configuration</strong></span> to tweak the performance of the Elastic Stack by changing the size of your instances, including of your Elasticsearch clusters, for example. You can also change the level of fault tolerance, configure additional features, and much more. <a class="xref" href="ece-customize-deployment.html" title="Customize Your Deployment">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>

</ul>

<li class="listitem">
After your deployment is ready, write down the password for the <code class="literal">elastic</code> user (or the <code class="literal">admin</code> user for version 2.x) and keep it somewhere safe. You need the password to connect to your Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana. (Missed it?

<p>That&#8217;s it! Now that you are up and running, <a class="xref" href="ece-getting-started-connect.html" title="Connect to Elasticsearch">connect to the Elasticsearch cluster</a> in your deployment, add some data, and then start exploring with Kibana, our open-source visualization tool. If you&#8217;re not familiar with adding data, yet, Kibana can show you how to index your data into Elasticsearch.</p>

<div class="admon_content">
<p>Want to take Kibana for a test ride first? In Kibana 6.4.0 and later, you can use the one-click sample data, which allows you to use Kibana without loading your own data.
