<p>Need a simple logging solution and want to give our Elastic Cloud Enterprise a try? Or perhaps you want to start with Elasticsearch and Kibana to search and visualize your data, and add machine learning when you&#8217;re ready? With our deployments running the Elastic Stack, you can. The same goes for deploying a hot-warm architecture with automatic index curation for more complex logging use cases and many other deployments. We know that use cases come in all shapes and sizes. The purpose of Elastic Cloud Enterprise is to work for yours.</p>
