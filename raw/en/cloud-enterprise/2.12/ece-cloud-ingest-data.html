<p>By now you&#8217;ve probably spun up a deployment and might be wondering what&#8217;s next. Congratulations on completing that first big step! Now let&#8217;s help you <em>do</em> something with it. You likely have data that you want to add, known as <em>ingesting</em> or <em>indexing</em>, to Elasticsearch, so let&#8217;s explore some options.</p>

<h3><a id="ece-ingest-methods"></a>Ingestion methods<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-62/docs/shared/ec-ce-cloud-ingest-data.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When it comes to delivering your data into the Elastic Stack, a variety of options are available. All of the documentation and tutorials listed here rely on one of four ingestion methods: Elastic Agent, Beats, Logstash, or a direct connection from a client application. You can use these options individually or in combination.</p>
<p>Trying to choose between Beats or Elastic Agent? Check out our comparison of supported inputs, outputs, and configurations: <a href="/guide/en/fleet/8.15/beats-agent-comparison.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Beats and Elastic Agent capabilities</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="ece-data-ingest-agent"></a>Elastic Agent and Fleet<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-62/docs/shared/ec-ce-cloud-ingest-data.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Elastic Agent offers a single, unified way to enable shipping monitoring data from multiple hosts or containers into the Elastic Stack. Elastic Agent serves as a convenient front end that uses Beats shippers or Elastic Endpoint under the covers. See the <a href="/guide/en/fleet/8.15/elastic-agent-installation.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Agents product documentation</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>Fleet provides a web-based UI in Kibana to add and manage integrations for popular services and platforms, as well as manage a fleet of Elastic Agents. To learn more about how these work, see the <a href="/guide/en/fleet/8.15/fleet-overview.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Fleet and Elastic Agent overview</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="ece-data-ingest-beats"></a>Beats<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-62/docs/shared/ec-ce-cloud-ingest-data.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>These lightweight shippers get installed as agents on the endpoint. The data that they collect gets <em>pushed</em> back to the Elasticsearch cluster. Each Beat is created with a specific purpose, making it possible to target and aggregate common data from a multitude of endpoints. Some Beats, like Filebeat, have modules that specialize them even further. Configure the Beat to use the <a class="xref" href="ece-cloud-id.html" title="Configure Beats and Logstash with Cloud ID">Cloud ID</a> to simplify sending data back to your deployment. TLS, basic authentication, and API key authentication are available to ensure that your data is shipped securely.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a short and incomplete list of the types of data that Beats can handle: log files, metrics, audit data, network traffic, uptime monitoring, and more. Learn about the possibilities from the <a href="/guide/en/beats/libbeat/8.15/getting-started.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Beats documentation</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="ece-data-ingest-logstash"></a>Logstash<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-62/docs/shared/ec-ce-cloud-ingest-data.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Logstash is an open source data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities. It can accept data that is pushed to it as well as <em>pull</em> data from external sources. Logstash has the added benefit of being able to persist information in queues if the cluster temporarily cannot accept data, smoothing out ingestion spikes. However, Logstash is not available as part of the Elastic Cloud Enterprise deployment and requires separate installation and maintenance. Use the <a class="xref" href="ece-cloud-id.html" title="Configure Beats and Logstash with Cloud ID">Cloud ID</a> to configure Logstash to work with a deployment. And, as with Beats, you have the option of using basic authentication or an API key for secure data transmission.</p>
<p>Learn more about the possible inputs, filters, and outputs from the <a href="/guide/en/logstash/8.15/introduction.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Logstash documentation</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="ece-data-ingest-client"></a>Language clients<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-62/docs/shared/ec-ce-cloud-ingest-data.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Elastic provides libraries for several programming languages that allow you to connect your code directly to your Elastic Cloud Enterprise deployment. A unique Cloud ID. TLS, basic authentication, and API key authentication methods are available to ensure that your data is shipped securely into Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>This approach is described in detail in the two guides:</p>

<p>There are number of ways for you to get a sample data set ingested into Elasticsearch. This gives you a convenient way to test drive the broad set of Kibana tools and visualizations before ingesting your own data. Several data packages are available with a one-click installation, as well as a <code class="literal">makelogs</code> script and a simple CSV upload method for more ingest options.</p>

<p>Whenever you add data into Elasticsearch indices, that data can be pre-processed using an Elasticsearch ingest pipeline. An ingest pipeline is an ideal way to optimize how your data is indexed. It simplifies tasks such as extracting error codes from a log file, or mapping geographic locations to IP addresses.
