<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>The frozen data tier is now available in Elastic Cloud Enterprise.</strong></span> A frozen data tier, powered by <a href="/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-searchable-snapshots" class="ulink" target="_top">searchable snapshots</a>, allows you to store large volumes of less frequently searched data in object storage including Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. The new data tier is designed to be so cost-effective you’ll never need to delete data. It is fully integrated with autoscaling, allowing you to seamlessly scale to store massive amounts of data. <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.6/data-tiers.html#frozen-tier" class="ulink" target="_top">Learn more&#8230;&#8203;</a></p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>New custom endpoint aliases.</strong></span> Custom endpoint aliases allow you to change the overly long, robotic URLs for your deployment and Elastic applications to something <em>you</em> choose. These predictable, human-readable URLs can be shared easily. An alias is unique to only one deployment within a region. They don&#8217;t replace the existing URL, but work alongside it. Best of both worlds. <a class="xref" href="ece-regional-deployment-aliases.html" title="Custom endpoint aliases">Learn more . . .</a></p>
<h3><a id="ece_enhancements_4"></a>Enhancements<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-62/docs/cloud-enterprise/releases/2.10.0/enhancement.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Display CPU when creating a deployment.</strong></span> The amount of CPU for each instance is now displayed when creating a deployment.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add instrumentation to ZooKeeper <code class="literal">create</code> calls.</strong></span> Adds instrumentation to ZooKeeper <code class="literal">create</code> calls, in order to track write transaction count and rate for the service.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add data tier instance filter.</strong></span> Adds the ability to filter deployment instances by data tier on the deployment overview page.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>APM plan handler to wait for Kibana version if APM version supports Fleet server.</strong></span> While processing an APM plan that supports Fleet Server (7.13+) the ECE constructor now waits for a Kibana cluster to be the same or greater version. This means that during upgrade of a deployment to version 7.13+, the constructor will not proceed with an APM plan until the Elasticsearch and Kibana plans are finished.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Frozen Tier stats display.</strong></span> Changes the display of frozen data nodes on the overview page. We were previously displaying normal disk allocation values, but those aren&#8217;t applicable because of searchable object storage. We now display the usage of that searchable object storage and the actual node size.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add Kibana configuration for cgroup based monitoring.</strong></span> With this change, the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Monitoring</strong></span> UI shows CPU and memory resource usage based on collected <code class="literal">cgroup</code> values for APM Server in versions <code class="literal">7.13+</code>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Show a warning on deployments using deprecated cross-cluster search templates.</strong></span> Owners of deprecated cross-cluster search deployments are now prompted to migrate to a new template prior to upgrading to future Elastic Stack versions.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Wait until API is healthy to exit upgrade process.</strong></span> This adds a step in the ECE upgrader to wait until the API is ready before exiting the process.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Platform UI redesign.</strong></span> Redesigned the UI around hosts, role management, allocators, proxies, and control planes.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Increase ZooKeeper timeouts.</strong></span> - Doubles the ZooKeeper <code class="literal">initLimit</code> and <code class="literal">syncLimit</code> timeouts to 14 and 6 respectively. Applies to ZooKeeper server processes and observers.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Move hardware profile to dropdown in advanced settings.</strong></span> When creating a deployment, the different hardware profile options are now available on the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> menu.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Do retries for failed keystore writes.</strong></span> Make allocations more resilient to transient Docker API errors by retrying Docker keystore writes if they fail.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Account UI Amsterdam fixes.</strong></span> When updating to the new Amsterdam EUI theme, it became clear that there were some visual issues in the account section. This solves many of them.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Dismiss autoscaling limit reached banner.</strong></span> Adds the ability to dismiss the "Autoscaling limits reached" banner.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Frozen tier display blob storage.</strong></span> Displays frozen tier storage as the amount of searchable storage available (a multiplier of 1600x the RAM size).</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Display changes in activity view by topology element ID if present.</strong></span> Configuration changes will now reference Elasticsearch topology elements by ID instead of their underlying hardware configuration, where possible.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fix styling for allocator query builder.</strong></span> The styling for the allocator query builder has been improved.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Update SLM health status behavior.</strong></span> When snapshot lifecycle management (SLM) is in use, snapshots should only be reported as unhealthy if SLM is suspended while there is no ongoing plan activity.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Only ignore allocation.require shard routing rules.</strong></span> Ensure that data tier shard routing allocation preferences are retained when restoring a deployment from snapshots, or restoring a snapshot from another deployment.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Upgrade ECE logging and metrics cluster bootstrap.</strong></span> As of version 2.9, ECE now automatically upgrades the Logging and Metrics system cluster to the latest bundled 7.x version of Elasticsearch. All new ECE installations 2.9 and later will also be created with a 7.x Logging and Metrics cluster.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Update UI to suppoort data tier removal.</strong></span> The updated UI enables users to disable optional data tiers.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>System cluster create and update in parallel.</strong></span> The ECE installer now creates the Security and Logging &amp; Metrics clusters at the same time, speeding up the initial installation time by several minutes. The ECE upgrader also now upgrades all eligible system clusters at the same time.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Reference certificate for default domain.</strong></span> Previously, we assumed the primary SSL certificate would have the root domain of <code class="literal">found.io</code>. This change makes it so we don&#8217;t assume a default domain at all. This was done in order to avoid a potentially very slow path of checking extraCerts. With recent work to improve the speed of <code class="literal">extraCerts</code> this is no longer necessary.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Remove NodeAttributeValidation from plan prerequisite validation.</strong></span> Remove plan validation which rejects plans that remove node attributes. This allows users to remove optional data tiers through the API.</p>
<h3><a id="ece_bug_fixes_10"></a>Bug fixes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-62/docs/cloud-enterprise/releases/2.10.0/bug.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Convert restore snapshot to deployment API.</strong></span> Fixed an issue where restoring snapshots on deployments that have converted to <code class="literal">node_roles</code> format was not working.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add subdomain for new deployment alias.</strong></span> Fixed a bug where the application subdomain, such as <em>es</em> for Elasticsearch and <em>kb</em> for Kibana, were not appearing in the URL displayed on the custom endpoint alias UI for new deployment aliases.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Do not send autoscaling values if autoscaling is not turned on.</strong></span> Removes autoscaling properties from being sent on create and update requests when <code class="literal">autoscaling_enabled</code> is set to <code class="literal">false</code>. This creates a better experience for users who view the equivalent API request, or if restoring from a snapshot.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Remove empty observability from plans.</strong></span> Fixes an issue where disabling logs and metrics would include an empty <code class="literal">observability</code> section in the plan change instead of removing the field entirely.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Return error on missing resources requiring SSO.</strong></span> A bug in Cloud SSO has been fixed where Deployment API PUT payloads are accepted that were missing resources requiring SSO SAML configuration. In this scenario the API call would succeed but the resulting plan change results in SSO breaking for the missing resources. Instead, an error is now returned for each missing resource requiring SAML configuration changes.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Support implicit stateless cluster versions in observability code.</strong></span> Fixed the following two bugs:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
When using implicit version in stateless resources (Kibana, APM, and Enterprise Search) the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Logs and Metrics</strong></span> page doesn&#8217;t show links to logs and metrics.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
When using implicit version in stateless resources (Kibana, APM, and Enterprise Search) legacy monitoring may be used instead of Metricbeat monitoring.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fix calculated timeout value.</strong></span> Fixes a bug where the calculated timeout for a deployment&#8217;s shutdown operation was too small, incorrectly causing shutdown plans to fail.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Show coordinating tier info in architecture summary.</strong></span> Fixed a bug that caused the summary section of the deployment page to not display settings for the coordinating tier.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>SAML UI: Avoid initializing the <code class="literal">use_single_logout</code> option when the form is loaded with value <code class="literal">false</code>.</strong></span> Fixed a bug in ECE UI which made SAML <em>Use single logout (SLO)</em> checkbox to be initially rendered as checked even when that setting is actually disabled in the configuration.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fixed warning when logs and metrics are disabled.</strong></span> Fixed a false negative warning "Resource plans are inconsistent with deployment logging and metrics settings. Please reapply desired settings" that was shown after disabling deployment logs and metrics.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Remove 0 size option for warm and cold tiers.</strong></span> Removes the ability to set a 0 size on warm and cold tiers if they are already sized when autoscaling is turned on. Removing warm and cold tiers isn&#8217;t currently supported as a safe operation.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Remove padding from Reset credentials modal.</strong></span> There was a minor UI bug that led to the Elastic credentials showing without left padding in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Reset credentials</strong></span> modal window. This has now been fixed.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>More selective voting exclusions.</strong></span> Fixed a bug that would add voting exclusions to Elasticsearch master nodes unnecessarily during forced restarts, sometimes leading to plan failures later.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Use <code class="literal">wait_for_removal=false</code> when cleaning up voting exclusions at the end of a plan.</strong></span> Plans for 7.x Elasticsearch clusters will now clean up lingering voting exclusions more consistently to prevent future plans from failing.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Logs and metrics - deployment query adds check for <code class="literal">owner_id</code>.</strong></span> Fixed a bug in the Logs and metrics UI where certain users would see a deployment from separate accounts when selecting a deployment.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Users see trust management section loading after a trusted deployment is deleted.</strong></span> Fixed a UI bug on the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Trust management</strong></span> page that resulted in a permanent loading state once a trusted deployment was deleted.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Remove thumbnail disabling pre-7.11.0.</strong></span> Removed the availability of <code class="literal">workplace_search.content_source.sync.thumbnails.enabled</code> configuration in 7.10.2, as this option is not available in the version 7.10.x line.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fix instance health reporting.</strong></span> Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause instances to be reported as healthy even if they were not. This could lead to cluster unavailability since these "unhealthy" instances would be taken out of the load balancer.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fix App Search to Enterprise Search upgrades.</strong></span> Fixed a bug that would prevent users from migrating App Search deployments to Enterprise Search for versions &gt;= 7.10.0.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add delay between cluster health checks.</strong></span> Fixed a bug that would cause the wait-until-cluster-ready-for-rolling constructor step to very aggressively check the cluster&#8217;s health (and issue an enormous amount of writes to Zookeeper) under certain conditions.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Increase size of Training button.</strong></span> Ensures that the size of the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Training</strong></span> button matches the size of other, similar buttons on the Elastic Cloud portal page.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Only ignore allocation.require shard routing rules.</strong></span> Ensure that data tier shard routing allocation preferences are retained when restoring a deployment from snapshots, or restoring a snapshot from another deployment.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Use aliased endpoints for logs and metrics links.</strong></span> Fixed an issue where the links to logs and metrics single-sign on doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Check <code class="literal">node_roles</code> for <code class="literal">voting_only</code> designation.</strong></span> Fixed a bug that could lead to quorum loss for Elasticsearch clusters version 7.11 or higher that are in exactly 2 availability zones (plus a tiebreaker) when running a plan to switch to dedicated masters.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Stop trying to query non-existent App Search.</strong></span> The Deployment Overview tab should no longer display an error if App Search is available but not enabled.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Adjust region query in the UI.</strong></span> Adjusted the UI query for selecting deployments within the same region to be less flexible.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>TCP RST cleanup.</strong></span> Fixed a bug where an improperly closed connection to the transport passthrough proxy would result in an idle backend connection remaining open.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Don&#8217;t rollback start-instances or allocate-instances.</strong></span> Instances created during a plan that fails will no longer attempt to be removed as part of the rollback (except when standing up brand new clusters). Deleting instances as part of rollback is prone to failure (making things even worse), and often isn&#8217;t the best choice anyway.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fix crashes in the deployment template view when the monitoring deployment couldn&#8217;t be found.</strong></span> When a deployment template included observability configuration, the deployment template view would incorrectly search for the referenced deployment by cluster ID, rather than deployment ID. When this failed to match any deployments the entire page would fail. We now correctly search by deployment ID, and show a relevant error when no deployment is found.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fix displayed frozen storage values.</strong></span> Displays the proper values for frozen storage in the summary footer on the edit page of the UI, and in the architecture summary bar.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Filter cluster metadata during <code class="literal">ConfigureAutoExpandIndexes</code>.</strong></span> The plan step "Adjusting auto-expand indexes in Elasticsearch" no longer queries metadata for all indices in the cluster. This change makes this step much faster for large clusters, reduces load imposed on the cluster, and prevents it from failing for clusters with several hundred megabytes of cluster state data.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Filter out searchable snapshots on SLM deployments only.</strong></span> Filters out searchable snapshots in snapshot lists for SLM deployments only, as they are incomplete snapshots that should not be restored from.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fix corrupt OOM heap dumps.</strong></span> Fixed an issue where heap dumps are sometimes corrupt when uploaded to snapshot storage.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>ECE platform settings fixes.</strong></span> Fixed a few title size issues on the platform settings page of the UI, as well as an alignment problem for the the switch button.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fleet configuration not working in ECE 2.10 with stack version 7.14.</strong></span> In ECE version 2.10 with the original Elastic Stack pack version 7.14, if downloaded from the Elastic website before August 10, 2021, Fleet does not work when enabled in a deployment. To support Fleet, you can <a class="xref" href="ece-manage-elastic-stack.html" title="Manage Elastic Stack versions">get and re-upload a fresh copy</a> of the version 7.14 Elastic Stack pack to overwrite the original one. If you have existing version 7.14 deployments, then restart Fleet/APM after re-uploading the Elastic Stack pack to enable Fleet.
