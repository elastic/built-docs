<p>This set of common symptoms and resolutions can help you to diagnose unexpected behavior with Elastic Cloud Enterprise. You can also refer to the list of product <a class="xref" href="ece-limitations.html" title="Limitations and known problems">Limitations and known problems</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="ece_emergency_token_not_spinning_up_the_coordinator_role"></a>Emergency token not spinning up the coordinator role<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-65/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Symptom:</strong></span> You have no access to API and UI because all coordinators are lost. More than half of the director hosts are available. If you have 5 directors, 3 directors must be available. If you lost more than half of the directors, contact the support. If all directors are lost, <a class="xref" href="ece-install-cloud.html" title="Install ECE">re-install ECE</a>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Resolution:</strong></span> Use the emergency token provided during the installation of the genesis ECE nodes. You must explicitly specify the roles with the parameter <code class="literal">--roles</code>, for example <code class="literal">"coordinator,director,proxy"</code>. Otherwise, the host does not run any role.</p>
<h3><a id="ece_installation_failures_with_firewalld_enabled_on_centos_and_rhel"></a>Installation failures with firewalld enabled on CentOS and RHEL<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-65/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Symptom:</strong></span> On CentOS and RHEL the installation of Elastic Cloud Enterprise fails, possibly indicating an issue that affects communication between Docker containers on the host.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Resolution:</strong></span> The issue might be caused by the firewalld service. The service is not compatible with Docker and interferes with the installation of ECE. You must disable firewalld with <code class="literal">sudo systemctl disable firewalld</code> and reboot before installing or reinstalling ECE.</p>
<p>To learn more, see the the configuration steps for <a class="xref" href="ece-configure-hosts-rhel-centos-cloud.html" title="Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS">Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="ece_allocator_failures"></a>Allocator failures<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-65/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Allocator failures result in alerts in the Cloud UI. You cannot repair an allocator in the Cloud UI, so you should first <a class="xref" href="ece-move-nodes.html" title="Move nodes or instances from allocators">move all nodes to a new allocator</a>.  Vacate options for a selected allocator can help fine tune the removal of nodes. After the allocator is vacated, you should investigate the cause of the failure separately, which could be due to a host machine failure, and replace any lost capacity.</p>
<h3><a id="ece-issues-allocator-usage"></a>Allocators not being used<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-65/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Symptoms:</strong></span> You installed Elastic Cloud Enterprise on a new host and assigned it the allocator role from the command line with the <code class="literal">--roles "allocator"</code> parameter during installation, but new clusters are not being created on the allocator.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Resolution:</strong></span> The issue is caused by a token specified with the <code class="literal">--roles-token 'TOKEN'</code> parameter that does not have sufficient privileges to assign the role correctly. To resolve this issue, you might need to refresh the roles for the allocator.</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">

Follow the steps for <a class="xref" href="ece-change-roles.html" title="Assign roles to hosts">assigning roles to hosts</a>, but do not change any of the assigned roles. Click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Update roles</strong></span>.

<h3><a id="ece_cloud_ui_login_failures"></a>Cloud UI login failures<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-65/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Symptoms:</strong></span> When you attempt to log into the Cloud UI, the login process appears to hang and then fails.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Resolution:</strong></span> The <a class="xref" href="ece-glossary.html#admin-console">administration console</a> that supports the Cloud UI might be running out of Java heap space, causing login failures. This issue is expected to be fixed in a future release. As a workaround, you can manually increase the heap size.</p>
<p>In the current release, there is no direct way to change the Java heap size in the UI, so you need to increase the heap size as follows:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Symptoms:</strong></span> When you attempt to log into the Cloud UI or when you attempt to connect to an Elasticsearch or Kibana endpoint URL, the connection eventually times out with an error. The error indicates that the host cannot be reached.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Resolution:</strong></span> On AWS, the default URLs provided might point to a private host IP address, which is not accessible externally. To resolve this issue, use a URL for the Cloud UI that is externally accessible and <a class="xref" href="ece-administering-endpoints.html" title="Change endpoint URLs">update your cluster endpoint</a> to use a public IP address for Elasticsearch and Kibana.</p>
<p>This issue applies only to hosts running on AWS, where both public and private IP addresses are provided.</p>
<p>To check if you are affected and to resolve this issue:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Compare the URL you are trying to reach to the host IP address information in the AWS EC2 Dashboard.</p>

<h3><a id="ece-troubleshooting-upgrade"></a>Upgrade failures<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-65/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Symptoms:</strong></span> When upgrading Elastic Cloud Enterprise, the upgrade process indicates that a container upgrade has failed, followed by a rollback of all container upgrades and an error message that the upgrade process has failed. The information you see is similar to this output:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">...
- Runner [192.168.44.10]: container [proxies-proxy] status changed: [upgrade failed] at [2017-08-23T20:27:02.114Z]
- Runner [192.168.44.10]: container [proxies-proxy] status changed: [rollback started] at [2017-08-23T20:27:07.134Z]
...
- The upgrade of the {n} installation has failed, but we successfully rolled back changes.
- Check that all services are running and that they are at the same version level with the docker ps command. Try the upgrade again.
- The log files on each host might provide additional information about the cause of the failures. (path: HOST_STORAGE_PATH/logs/upgrader-logs).
- You can find a backup of ZooKeeper's transaction log that was created before the upgrade in [/mnt/data/elastic/192.168.44.10/services/zookeeper/data/backup/20170823-202249/version-2].
- Exiting upgrader
- Removing upgrade container</pre>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Resolution:</strong></span> The Elastic Cloud Enterprise upgrade process is designed to be safe. If there is an issue with any part of the upgrade, the entire process is rolled back. In most cases, the rollback is automatic and the upgrade process can be reattempted after you fix the issue that caused the rollback.</p>
<p>The upgrade process can fail for several reasons, including:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
If a host fails during the upgrade process, causing the <code class="literal">frc-upgraders-monitor</code> container to time out while it monitors the upgrade process.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If there is an issue with the ZooKeeper ensemble establishing a quorum after the upgrade or if the <code class="literal">frc-upgraders-upgrader</code> containers performing the upgrade on each host continue to wait for a ZooKeeper connection indefinitely to report their upgrade status.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If an upgraded container does not keep running and the upgrade process determines that it is not viable.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To determine the root cause of an upgrade failure, the following logs are available where <code class="literal">HOST_STORAGE_PATH</code> and <code class="literal">RUNNER_ID</code> are specific to your installation:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">HOST_STORAGE_PATH/logs/upgrader-logs/monitor.log</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Available on the host where you initiated the upgrade process. This log file can help you pinpoint the host where an upgrade issue occurred or where in the overall upgrade process a failure happened.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">HOST_STORAGE_PATH/logs/upgrader-logs/upgrader.log</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Available on every host that attempted the upgrade. This log file can tell you about the specific issues that caused the upgrade to fail on a host.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>In rare cases, a manual rollback of the upgrade might be required. To have someone walk you through the process, see <a class="xref" href="ece-getting-help.html" title="Ask for help">Getting help</a>.</p>
