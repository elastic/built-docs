<p>When you installed Elastic Cloud Enterprise and <a class="xref" href="ece-login.html" title="Log into the Cloud UI">logged into the Cloud UI</a> for the first time, you were greeted by two deployments. We&#8217;ve also shown you how to <a class="xref" href="ece-create-deployment.html" title="Create your deployment">create your own first deployment</a>, but that still only makes a few deployments. What if you had hundreds of deployments to look after or maybe even a thousand? How would you find the ones that need your attention?</p>
<p>The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Deployments</strong></span> page in the Cloud UI provides several ways to find deployments that might need your attention, whether that&#8217;s deployments that have a problem or deployments that are at a specific version level or really almost anything you might want to find on a complex production system:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Check the visual health indicators of deployments
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Search for partial or whole deployment names or IDs in the search text box
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Add filters to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Deployments</strong></span> view to filter for specific conditions:</p>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<p>Looking for all deployments of a specific version, because you want to upgrade them? Easy. Or what about that deployments you noticed before lunch that seemed to be spending an awfully long time changing its configuration&#8212;&#8203;is it done? Just add a filter to find any ongoing configuration changes.</p>
