<span class="term">
<a id="plan"></a>plan
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Specifies the configuration and topology of an Elasticsearch or Kibana cluster, such as capacity, availability, and Elasticsearch version, for example.

</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Enables a host to join an existing ECE installation and grants permission to hosts to hold certain roles, such as the <a class="xref" href="ece-glossary.html#allocator">allocator</a> role. Used when installing ECE on additional hosts, a roles token helps secure ECE by making sure that only authorized hosts become part of the installation.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="runner"></a>runner
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A local control agent that runs on all hosts, used to deploy local containers based on role definitions. Ensures that containers assigned to it exist and are able to run, and creates or recreates the containers if necessary.

<a id="tiebreaker"></a>tiebreaker
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Prevents cases of <a href="/blog/found-elasticsearch-in-production#split-brains" class="ulink" target="_top">split brain</a> in distributed clusters, where a cluster splits into multiple, autonomous parts that continue to handle requests independently of each other, at the risk of affecting cluster consistency and data loss. Ensures a quorum-based majority of (<em>n</em>/2)+1 nodes, where <em>n</em> is the number of nodes in the cluster. The minimum number of master nodes to reach quorum in a two-node cluster is the same as for a three-node cluster: two nodes must be available.

<a id="zookeeper"></a>ZooKeeper
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A coordination service for distributed systems used by Elastic Cloud Enterprise to store the state of the installation. Responsible for discovery of hosts, resource allocation, leader election after failure and high priority notifications.
