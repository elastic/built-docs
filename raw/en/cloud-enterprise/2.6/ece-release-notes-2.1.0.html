<p>Highlights for Elastic Cloud Enterprise version 2.1.0:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Run cross-cluster searches.</strong></span> The Cross-Cluster Search API is now available and allows any node to act as a federated client across multiple clusters. A cross-cluster search node connects to a remote cluster in order to execute federated search requests, without joining that node to the remote cluster. Benefits of cross-cluster search include more powerful logging scenarios and the ability to split up monolithic deployments. <a class="xref" href="ece-enable-ccs.html" title="Enable cross-cluster search">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Deploy APM Server.</strong></span> When you create or edit Elastic Stack deployments, you can now stand up an APM Server and get the secret token to configure your APM Agents. The APM Server is already hooked up to work with Elasticsearch and Kibana. <a class="xref" href="ece-manage-apm.html" title="Manage your APM Server">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a></p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>APM requires 6.3.0 or later, but you can upgrade your deployment to a supported version first, then add APM to your deployment.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Restrict connections with IP Filtering.</strong></span> An important security layer to control traffic to your deployments, you can now apply IP filtering to application clients, node clients, or transport clients, in addition to other nodes that are attempting to join an Elasticsearch cluster. You enable IP filtering by creating rule sets that allow specific IP Addresses. <a class="xref" href="ece-traffic-filtering-ip.html" title="IP traffic filters">Learn More &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Keep sensitive settings in the Elasticsearch keystore.</strong></span> Elastic Cloud Enterprise now supports the Elasticsearch keystore as a RESTful API-only feature that allows you to securely store your settings. <a class="xref" href="ece-configuring-keystore.html" title="Secure your settings">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>New versions of the Elastic Stack.</strong></span> Elastic Cloud Enterprise now supports the latest versions of the Elastic Stack, including 5.6.14 and 6.6.0.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Disk-based shard allocation settings are now enabled by default.</strong></span> These settings affect only newly created clusters.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Proxy HTTP requests to clusters via the API.</strong></span> This allows you to send RESTful API requests to a specific cluster.
</li>
</ul>

<p>To upgrade to Elastic Cloud Enterprise version 2.1.0, see <a class="xref" href="ece-upgrade.html" title="Upgrade your installation">Upgrade your installation</a> and take note of the updated installation prerequisites for Docker in the next section. For offline (air-gapped) installations: After you complete the upgrade, you must also download the APM server images for the Elastic Stack versions that you plan to use.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>New recommended Docker version.</strong></span> After internal testing, we now officially support and recommend Docker 18.09.02 as an installation prerequisite for Elastic Cloud Enterprise. To learn more about the installation of Docker for supported Linux distributions, see <a class="xref" href="ece-configuring.html" title="Preparing your environment">Preparing your environment</a>. For existing installations, follow the steps in <a class="xref" href="ece-perform-host-maintenance.html" title="Perform host maintenance">Perform host maintenance</a> when upgrading to Docker 18.09.02.</p>
<p>Previously, we primarily recommended Docker 1.11 for use with Elastic Cloud Enterprise. We no longer recommend this version, but some Linux distributions might work with other versions of Docker. To see which versions of Docker we support, see <a class="xref" href="ece-prereqs-software-linux.html" title="Linux distributions">Linux distributions</a>.</p>
