<p>This version includes fixes for the following bugs and known issues:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
There were no link to cluster logs in external links for App Search and Enterprise Search in the UI. Links to logs and metrics links are now displayed correctly.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Migrating to ECE 2.5.0 could lead to deployment configurations to be flagged as deprecated and needing to  be updated. The required deployment configuration update should be performed automatically when you upgrade to 2.5.1.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Upgrading plans with snapshot lifecycle management enabled failed when no Elasticsearch cluster was available. We removed the requirement, as it is no longer needed by snapshot lifecycle management, and upgrades now work as expected.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The ECE upgrader could finish with an exception in the upgrade logs despite performing a successful upgrade. This behavior is now fixed and exception will only be logged when an upgrade fails.
</li>
</ul>
