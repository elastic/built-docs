<p>These steps show how you can safely perform maintenance on hosts in your ECE installation. Host maintenance refers to actions that are not part of taking care of Elastic Cloud Enterprise itself and that you might need to perform for a number of different reasons, including:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
To apply urgent operating system patches or hot fixes
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To perform regularly scheduled software or hardware upgrades
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To enable new features, such as encryption of data at rest
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To meet updated installation prerequisites
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You can perform these maintenance actions on your hosts using one of these methods:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="ece-perform-host-maintenance.html#ece-perform-host-maintenance-docker-disable" title="By disabling the Docker daemon">By disabling the Docker daemon (nondestructive)</a>

<a class="xref" href="ece-perform-host-maintenance.html#ece-perform-host-maintenance-delete-runner" title="By deleting the runner">By deleting the runner from your ECE installation (destructive)</a>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Which method you choose depends on how invasive your host maintenance needs to be. If your host maintenance could affect ECE, use the destructive method that first deletes the runner from your installation. Both methods include a step that moves any hosted Elasticsearch clusters and Kibana instances off the affected runners and are generally considered safe, provided that your ECE installation still has sufficient resources available to operate after the host has been removed.</p>
<h3><a id="ece-perform-host-maintenance-docker-disable"></a>By disabling the Docker daemon<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-47/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-performing-host-maintenance.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>This method lets you perform maintenance actions on hosts without first removing the associated runner from your Elastic Cloud Enterprise installation. It works by disabling the Docker daemon. The runner remains a part of your ECE installation throughout these steps but will be offline and the resources it provides will not be available.</p>
<p>To perform host maintenance:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Recommended: If the runner holds the allocator role and you have enough spare capacity:</p>

<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="ece-move-nodes.html" title="Move nodes or instances from allocators">Move all nodes off the allocator</a> and to other allocators in your installation.

<p>Skipping Step 1 will affect the availability of clusters with nodes on the allocator. Skip at your own risk. Any tags associated with the allocator might also be lost and need to be added back.</p>

<p>This method lets you perform potentially destructive maintenance actions on hosts. It works by deleting the associated runner, which removes the host from your Elastic Cloud Enterprise installation. To add the runner to your ECE installation again after host maintenance is complete, you must reinstall ECE.</p>
