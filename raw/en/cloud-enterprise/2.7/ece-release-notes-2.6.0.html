<p>New for Elastic Cloud Enterprise 2.6.0:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Better traffic management</strong></span>. Elastic Cloud Enterprise now supports two major traffic management features:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>AWS Private Link support.</strong></span> Elastic Cloud Enterprise now integrates with AWS Private link, which allows you to expose the service as a private IP in your VPC. Securely connect to your deployments without ever having to go over-the-wire. AWS Private link support is especially useful if you already use AWS to run your workloads and need to limit access to your deployments, so that they are accessible only from within your VPC. <a class="xref" href="ece-traffic-filtering-vpc.html" title="Private link traffic filters">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>IP filtering.</strong></span> You can now limit access to your deployments hosted on Elastic Cloud Enterprise to a specific list of whitelisted IPs. IP filtering is useful if you have a list of known IPs that your users are connecting from. You can use this feature to limit access from your internal company network or VPC, where all connections are going out from a common gateway, for example. <a class="xref" href="ece-traffic-filtering-ip.html" title="IP traffic filters">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Enterprise Search</strong></span>. App Search and Workplace Search are now available in Elastic Cloud Enterprise as a combined Enterprise Search deployment. From mobile applications to geo-localized search, App Search provides a set of tools that cater to both technical and non-technical search managers on your team to customize the application search experience and results. Workplace Search makes your teams' content findable, fast. Content platforms such as Google Drive, Salesforce, and many others, can be combined to create a unified and personalized search experience. <a class="xref" href="ece-enable-enterprise-search.html" title="Enable Enterprise Search">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>New supported Linux distributions.</strong></span> With this version of ECE, we now officially support and recommend the following Linux distributions: <a class="xref" href="ece-configure-hosts-ubuntu-cloud.html" title="Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) and 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)">Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)</a> and <a class="xref" href="ece-configure-hosts-rhel-centos-cloud.html" title="Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS">Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 and CentOS 8</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>New recommended Docker version.</strong></span> We now officially support and recommend Docker 19.03 as an installation prerequisite for ECE. To learn more about the installation of Docker for supported Linux distributions, see <a class="xref" href="ece-configure-os-cloud.html" title="Configure your operating system">Configure your operating system</a>.

<h3><a id="ece_whats_changed_2"></a>What&#8217;s changed<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-47/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-release-notes.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>We renamed one model in our OpenAPI specification that affects the deprecated Clusters API. This does not change the API itself, but it requires changes in your code if you are using a client generated from our OpenAPI specification. If this is the case, you need to change the name of this model in your code:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Previous name: <code class="literal">co.elastic.cloud.apiclient.model.ElasticsearchClusterSettings</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
New name: <code class="literal">co.elastic.cloud.apiclient.model.DeprecatedElasticsearchClusterSettings</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The Deployment API is not affected by this change. Since the Clusters API is scheduled for removal in ECE 3.0, we encourage you to migrate your code to use the new Deployments API that replaces the deprecated Clusters API.</p>
<h3><a id="ece_breaking_changes"></a>Breaking Changes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-47/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-release-notes.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The in-place configuration change improvements included in this release mean that single availability zone deployments will be temporarily unavailable while the change is applied. If availability is a concern, you should use two availability zones for your deployment, which requires no downtime and which ensures deployment availability during future configuration changes, upgrades, and hardware failures.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>As a best practice for production setups, you should never run with a single availability zone if downtime is a concern.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><a id="ece_deprecation"></a>Deprecation<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-47/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-release-notes.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Version 3.0.0 will include the following breaking change:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>The field <code class="literal">ccs</code> in <code class="literal">co.elastic.cloud.apiclient.model.ElasticsearchClusterSettings</code> has been deprecated and will no longer be supported in version 3.0.0. This field was used to configure remote clusters and retrieve the remote clusters of an elasticsearch cluster.
As a replacement, there are now two specific endpoints that should be used to update and retrieve the remote clusters:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">GET /api/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/elasticsearch/{ref_id}/remote-clusters</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">PUT /api/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/elasticsearch/{ref_id}/remote-clusters</code>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This change is needed in order to support configuration of remote clusters through Kibana and the Elasticsearch API directly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a id="ece_known_problems"></a>Known problems<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-47/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-release-notes.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>This version of ECE has a known problem with the resizing of system-owned clusters: if you apply a configuration change that only adds more zones to the cluster, the change will cause some downtime. As a workaround to avoid the downtime, you can select the grow-and-shrink approach in the UI when you apply the configuration change.</p>
<p><em>Release date: August 18, 2020</em></p>
