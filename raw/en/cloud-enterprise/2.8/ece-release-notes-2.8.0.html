<p>We&#8217;re starting off the new year with a release that&#8217;s all about cleaning house. Just a few smaller features, plenty of enhancements, and squashing some bugs.</p>
<p>This version of Elastic Cloud Enterprise is bundled with our latest Elastic Stack 7.11. To learn more about best practices when upgrading deployments from previous versions of the Elastic Stack, see <a class="xref" href="ece-upgrade-deployment.html" title="Upgrade versions">Upgrade versions</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="ece_features"></a>Features<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-49/docs/cloud-enterprise/releases/2.8.0/feature.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add Support portal link.</strong></span> For users with a Support account, the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/help" class="ulink" target="_top">Help</a> page now includes a link to the Elastic Support portal.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add endpoint for determining supported applications.</strong></span> Add an endpoint listing the applications that the user can access from Okta.</p>
<p><code class="literal">curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" http://192.168.40.10.ip.es.io:22400/api/v1/saas/user/applications</code></p>
<p>Sample response:</p>
<pre class="screen">{
    "applications": [
        "training",
        "dream-machine"
    ]
}</pre>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Migrate old remote search clusters to use the xEnvCCSCCR.</strong></span> During an upgrade to ECE version 2.8, all remote search clusters on versions 6.7 or higher get migrated away from the legacy remote search implementation that relied on the constructor updating seed nodes. The new functionality ships data through the proxy which is more robust, simpler to maintain, and compatible with future support for connecting with clusters in different ECE installations.</p>
<h3><a id="ece_enhancements"></a>Enhancements<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-49/docs/cloud-enterprise/releases/2.8.0/enhancement.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add Kibana deep linking to the "waiting" banner link.</strong></span> Adds deep links to the waiting banner - so when you create an Observability deployment, for example, the "Open Kibana" link brings you to the Observability area.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Log delivery create deployment button and clear logs from UI.</strong></span> - Add button to create a monitoring deployment on the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Logs and Metrics</strong></span> page when only one or no deployment are available.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Mandatory storage multiplier in instance configuration.</strong></span> A field <code class="literal">diskQuotaMultiplier</code> (or API&#8217;s <code class="literal">storage_multiplier</code>) of Instance configuration becomes mandatory on reading and writing. This does not affect the API contract where that field is optional (but filled out by default taken from settings during the conversion to the persistent model)</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Default disk quota multipliers (constructor).</strong></span> The constructor service is updated to recognize default disk quota multipliers for each known cluster type.</p>
<p>The constructor now supports three new environment variables:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>ES_DISK_QUOTA_MULTIPLIER</strong></span> - Default disk quota multiplier for Elasticsearch instances. If the multiplier is not defined in an instance configuration, this value is used. Optional. <em>The default value is 32.</em>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>KB_DISK_QUOTA_MULTIPLIER</strong></span> - Default multiplier for Kibana. Optional. <em>The default value is 4.</em>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>APM_DISK_QUOTA_MULTIPLIER</strong></span> - Default multiplier for APM. Optional. <em>The default value is 4.</em>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Make API keys API endpoint public.</strong></span> You can now manage API keys via the keys API endpoint in addition to managing them through the UI.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Log delivery - No Deployments dropdown.</strong></span> Updates content when enabling monitoring and adds a message <em>No compatible deployments</em> when no deployments are available.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add dedicated master nodes when autoscaling a cluster.</strong></span> The autoscaling request handler can now perform post-processing of scaled cluster specification and automatically add dedicated masters, if the number of nodes (any combination of roles, other than dedicated masters) exceeds the threshold. The default number of nodes is six and is defined in the cluster settings.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add account id on deployment alias znode.</strong></span> @Elastic Adds <code class="literal">account_id</code> to the zNode for a regional deployment alias in preparation for allowing remapping.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Update Okta profile with ESS User ID.</strong></span> Store ESS user IDs in an Okta&#8217;s custom attribute <code class="literal">users.essUserId</code></p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add node_roles support to the EsClusterTopologyElement.</strong></span> Add a new nodeRoles field to the EsClusterTopologyElement for Elasticsearch version 7.10 and later.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add Workplace Search sync monitor configs.</strong></span> Add Workplace Search content source sync error configurations to the configuration allowlist (whitelist).</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add support for reporting metrics to APM via micrometer.</strong></span> Add support for reporting metrics to APM via micrometer.</p>
<h3><a id="ece_bug_fixes"></a>Bug fixes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-49/docs/cloud-enterprise/releases/2.8.0/bug.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fixed container scheduled service connections leak</strong></span>.  We added a new container scheduled task service in release <code class="literal">2.7.0</code> for running miscellaneous administrative tasks on runners with the <code class="literal">allocator</code> role. Unfortunately, this new service was causing an excessive number of connections to be created to the ZooKeeper coordination services. This release addresses the resource leak.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Hides messages the deployment is still being created.</strong></span> Hide some transient configuration messages on overview page while a deployment is creating.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Snapshot suspension correction.</strong></span> During plan changes, snapshots are automatically suspended to avoid conflict. Fixes an issue where occasionally snapshotting would remain suspended.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fix YAML parser in UI.</strong></span> Fixes a bug where attempting to save YAML settings, that only include comments, resulted in an error message: <code class="literal">The YAML settings are invalid, please check your syntax</code>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Remove issue time so that JWT doesn&#8217;t change from plan to plan.</strong></span> Fixes an issue where if log delivery is enabled, a force restart of the plan could cause instances to be created.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Configures SSO properly with defaults.</strong></span> If the Elastic Stack version is left out of the API call, the system chooses the latest generally available version. This release fixes an issue where SSO into Kibana was not configured if the Elastic Stack version was left out.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Navigation breadcrumbs not displaying correctly.</strong></span> Fixes the breadcrumbs on the authentication provider screens.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fix boot looping error message</strong></span> Fixes a misleading error message that claimed an instance is boot looping even if it may not have been.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fix issue where APM or AppSearch could get flagged valid for SSO.</strong></span> The Cloud Deployments API has a bug fixed where requests to create or update a deployment can fail in some cases when APM resources share the same <code class="literal">ref_id</code> value as Kibana or Enterprise Search. The bug caused the API to consider APM valid for SSO, which would result in a failed validation for the updated deployment plan.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fix JSON search slow logs and deprecation logs.</strong></span> Fixed an issue where, when log delivery is enabled, slow logs are not always ingested.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fix missing "basic" auth provider</strong></span> For Cloud SSO, a basic username and password form should be displayed when a user does not have any other auth providers configured in the Kibana custom settings. This fixes a bug that earlier could prevent the "basic" provider from being used when SAML realm SSO settings are updated.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fix missing SSO on deployment update.</strong></span> Fixes a bug where single sign-on (SSO) is not enabled when a new (version 7.7.0 and later) Kibana or (version 7.9.2 and later) Enterprise Search instance is added to a deployment.</p>
<h4><a id="ece_known_issues"></a>Known issues<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-49/docs/cloud-enterprise/releases/2.8.0/bug.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>In some cases, version 7.11 deployments might not detect the <a class="xref" href="ece-software-prereq.html#ece-xfs" title="XFS">XFS quota</a> set in ECE. The quota won&#8217;t be exceeded, but deployments may not detect that they are running low on disk space. If you encounter this problem, as a workaround you can <a class="xref" href="ece-manage-elastic-stack.html" title="Manage Elastic Stack versions">upload a new version 7.11 stack pack from our website</a>. Then, open the deployment Edit page and click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> to reapply the current deployment settings with the refreshed stack pack. If you upload a version 7.11.0 stack pack before upgrading to ECE 2.8.0 (or version 7.11.1 before upgrading to ECE 2.8.1) this issue will not occur.</p>
<p>Upgrading to ECE 2.8 will also upgrade the security cluster to Stack version 7.11, where an Elasticsearch known bug may prevent customers from authenticating if they use an AD or LDAP external realm. This will be fixed in an upcoming patch version of Elasticsearch and ECE.</p>
