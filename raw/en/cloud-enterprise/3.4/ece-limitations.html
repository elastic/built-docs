When you install Elastic Cloud Enterprise on a new host and assign it the allocator role from the command line with the <code class="literal">--roles "allocator"</code> parameter during installation, new deployments might not get created on the allocator.

Due to a <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56739" class="ulink" target="_top">known Elasticsearch bug</a>, plans for Elasticsearch versions 7.7.0 and 7.7.1 can fail unexpectedly with an error that indicates that there was a bad request while performing the constructor&#8217;s step <code class="literal">validate-enough-disk-space</code>. To resolve this, first try manually restarting all nodes of the cluster. If restarting doesn&#8217;t resolve the problem, you can edit the cluster plan to set the <code class="literal">override_failsafe</code> option to <code class="literal">true</code>. We also recommend upgrading to version 7.8 or higher, which resolves this bug.

A known issue can prevent direct rolling upgrades from Elasticsearch version 5.6.10 to version 6.3.0. As a workaround, we have removed version 6.3.0 from the Cloud UI for new cluster deployments and for upgrading existing ones. If you are affected by this issue, check <a href="https://elastic.my.salesforce.com/articles/Support_Article/Rolling-upgrades-to-6-3-0-from-5-x-fails-with-java-lang-IllegalStateException-commit-doesn-t-contain-history-uuid?popup=false&amp;id=kA0610000005JFG" class="ulink" target="_top">Rolling upgrades from 5.6.x to 6.3.0 fails with "java.lang.IllegalStateException: commit doesn&#8217;t contain history uuid"</a> in our Elastic Support Portal.

When upgrading to 2.4.0, make sure that nothing listens on your proxy node over port 9000. If a Minio repository runs on the same ECE node, you&#8217;ll need to change the default listening port. If there is a port conflict, proxy fails and won&#8217;t boot.

Starting with ECE version 2.6.0, deployment upgrades initiated from the UI can fail if there is no healthy instance of Kibana available. As a workaround, you can perform an advanced edit on the cluster to upgrade the cluster version. In the cluster configuration, each occurrence of <code class="literal">elasticsearch.version</code> can be updated to the version that you choose.

When upgrading to ECE version 2.7.0 the automatic upgrade of the <code class="literal">admin-console-elasticsearch</code> cluster may fail, particularly on older installations of ECE that started with a 5.x cluster. If this happens, it is safe to leave the cluster at the latest 6.x Elasticsearch version until the automatic upgrade is fixed in the next version of ECE. Note that the <code class="literal">logging-and-metrics</code> cluster should also remain on 6.x, only the <code class="literal">security</code> cluster should be upgraded to the latest 7.x Elasticsearch version using the <a class="xref" href="update-security-deployment.html" title="Update security deployment">dedicated API</a>.

When upgrading from version 2.9.x (2.9.0, 2.9.1, 2.9.2) to a version between 2.10.0 and 2.11.0, you might get an error that indicates deployment aliases cannot be set <a class="xref" href="ece-configuring-deployment-aliases.html" title="Enable custom endpoint aliases">in the console</a>. As a workaround, you can fix it using the <a class="xref" href="create-config-store-option.html" title="Create Config Store Option">dedicated API</a> by setting the value of <code class="literal">config_option_id</code> to <code class="literal">enable-deployment-alias</code> and the value of request body to <code class="literal">{ "value": "false" }</code>.

<h3><a id="ece-restrictions-transport-client"></a>Transport client<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-78/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-limitations-known-problems.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The transport client is not considered thread safe in a cloud environment. We recommend that you use the Java REST client instead. This restriction relates to the fact that your deployments hosted on Elastic Cloud Enterprise are behind proxies, which prevent the transport client from communicating directly with Elasticsearch clusters.</p>
<p>The transport client does not work with Elasticsearch clusters at version 7.6 and later that are managed by ECE. The transport client continues to work with Elasticsearch clusters at version 7.5 and earlier. Note that the transport client was deprecated with Elasticsearch version 7.0 and will be removed with 8.0.</p>

<p>In ECE version 2.10 with the original Elastic Stack pack version 7.14, if downloaded from the Elastic website before August 10, 2021, Fleet does not work when enabled in a deployment. To support Fleet, you can <a class="xref" href="ece-manage-elastic-stack.html" title="Manage Elastic Stack versions">get and re-upload a fresh copy</a> of the version 7.14 Elastic Stack pack to overwrite the original one. If you have existing version 7.14 deployments, then restart Fleet/APM after re-uploading the Elastic Stack pack to enable Fleet. This issue will be addressed in later stack packs and ECE versions.</p>

<p>A bug in Elastic Stack versions 8.1 and later may lead to a full disk for Elastic APM users with tail-based sampling enabled. A fix has been merged and will be released in a future version.</p>
