<p>In order to establish a remote connection between two remote clusters, they must both trust each other. Trust is bi-directional: If one of the clusters doesn&#8217;t trust the other, the remote connection won&#8217;t be established.</p>
<p>Mutual trust between two clusters is required to <a class="xref" href="ece-enable-ccs.html" title="Enable cross-cluster search and cross-cluster replication">enable cross-cluster search and cross-cluster replication</a>.</p>
<p>Trust can be configured individually for each deployment.</p>

<p>By default, any deployment that you or your users create trusts all other deployments in the same Elastic Cloud Enterprise environment. You can change this behavior in the Cloud UI under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Platform</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong strong"><strong>Trust Management</strong></span>, so that when a new deployment is created it does not trust any other deployment.
You can choose one of the following options:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Trust all my deployments - New deployments will by default trust any other deployment from your ECE environment (even deployments that don&#8217;t exist when the deployment is created).

<p>In order to configure remote clusters in other ECE environments, you will first need to establish a bi-directional trust relationship between both ECE environments:</p>

<p>Now, deployments in those environments will be able to configure trust with deployments in the other environment.
