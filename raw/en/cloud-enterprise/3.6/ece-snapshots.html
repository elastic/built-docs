<p>Snapshots provide backups of your Elasticsearch indices. You can use snapshots to recover from a failure when not enough availability zones are used to provide high availability or to recover from accidental deletion.</p>

<p>To enable snapshots for your Elasticsearch clusters and to work with them, you must <a class="xref" href="ece-manage-repositories.html" title="Manage snapshot repositories">have configured a repository</a>. After you have configured a snapshot repository, a snapshot is taken every 30 minutes or at the interval that you specify.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Snapshots back up only open indices. If you close an index, it is not included in snapshots and you will not be able to restore the data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Beginning with Elastic Stack version 7.6</strong></span>, use Kibana to manage your snapshots. In Kibana, you can set up additional repositories where the snapshots are stored, other than the one currently managed by Elastic Cloud Enterprise. You can view and delete snapshots, and configure a snapshot lifecycle management (SLM) policy to automate when snapshots are created and deleted. To learn more, check the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/snapshots-take-snapshot.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Snapshot and Restore</a> documentation.</p>
<p>To use the snapshot lifecycle management features available starting in Elastic Stack version 7.6 you must also be using Elastic Cloud Enterprise version 2.5 or higher. If you upgrade to Elastic Stack version 7.6 in an earlier ECE version, when you upgrade to ECE version 2.5, on the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Snapshots</strong></span> page you will have an option to initiate the migration to SLM. As well, if you create a deployment using Stack version 7.6.0 and an ECE version prior to 2.5, when you upgrade your ECE version to 2.5 you also need to upgrade your deployment to the next minor release after 7.6.0.</p>
<p>From within the Elastic Cloud Enterprise you can <a class="xref" href="ece-snapshots.html#ece-list-snapshots" title="List available snapshots">view the list of snapshots</a> and also <a class="xref" href="ece-snapshots.html#ece-restore-snapshot" title="Restore a snapshot">restore a snapshot</a> from a different deployment in the same region.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>For deployments with Elastic Stack versions 7.5 and below</strong></span>, You can configure the ECE snapshot count to keep up to a maximum of the 100 most recent, successful snapshots. Once your cluster has reached the total snapshot count, ECE removes old snapshots as new ones are taken. These tasks are available from the Elastic Cloud Enterprise UI:</p>

<p>For Elastic Stack versions 7.6 and above, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/snapshots-take-snapshot.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Snapshot and Restore</a> documentation to learn about the snapshot management features.</p>
<p>For Elastic Stack versions 7.5 and below, from within Elastic Cloud Enterprise you can set the snapshot interval and count to have control over the retention period for your clusters. The calculation displayed is based on a projected estimate of the snapshot interval, expected snapshot count, and current cluster size. Changing any of these factors results in a different retention period.</p>

<p>If you find the the default snapshot interval isn&#8217;t working for your environment, you can change it. It might make sense to use a 4 or 24 hour interval if the data in your index doesn&#8217;t change that often but you need more snapshot history.</p>

<p>Snapshots can be restored to either the same Elasticsearch cluster or to another cluster. If you are restoring all indices to another cluster, you can <em>clone</em> a cluster.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Users created using the X-Pack security features or using Shield are not included when you restore across clusters, only data from Elasticsearch indices is restored. If you do want to create a cloned cluster with the same users as your old cluster, you need to recreate the users manually on the new cluster.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Restoring to another cluster is useful for scenarios where isolating activities on a separate cluster is beneficial, such as:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Performing ad hoc analytics
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
For most logging and metrics use cases, it is cost prohibitive to have all the data in memory, even if it would provide the best performance for aggregations. Cloning the relevant data to an ad hoc analytics cluster that can be discarded after use is a cost effective way to experiment with your data, without risk to existing clusters used for production.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Enabling your developers
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Realistic test data is crucial for uncovering unexpected errors early in the development cycle. What can be more realistic than actual data from a production cluster? Giving your developers access to real production data is a great way to break down silos.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Testing mapping changes
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Mapping changes almost always require reindexing. Unless your data volume is trivial, reindexing requires time and tweaking the parameters to achieve the best reindexing performance usually takes a little trial and error. While this use case could also be handled by running the scan and scroll query directly against the source cluster, a long lived scroll has the side effect of blocking merges even if the scan query is very light weight.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Integration testing
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Test your application against a real live Elasticsearch cluster with actual data. If you automate this, you could also aggregate performance metrics from the tests and use those metrics to detect if a change in your application has introduced a performance degradation.

<h4><a id="ece-restore-snapshots-containing-searchable-snapshots-indices-across-clusters"></a>Restore snapshots containing searchable snapshots indices across clusters<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-92/docs/shared/ec-ce-working-with-snapshots.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>If you are restoring a snapshot from one cluster to another, and that snaphot contains indices that are backed by searchable snapshots, there are a few more requirements to be aware of.</p>
<p>The first versions of Elasticsearch that supported searchable snapshots required that the repository name in the destination cluster, where the snapshot is to be restored from, match the repository name in the source cluster, where the snapshot was taken. Beginning with Elasticsearch version 7.12 this requirement is no longer present, but there are other prerequisites that need to be met.</p>
<p>Pre-requisites for restoring snapshots containing searchable snapshot indices across clusters:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>The source cluster must have been created as version 7.12.0 or higher.</p>
<p>To be more precise the requirement is on the <code class="literal">found-snapshots</code> repository settings at the time the snapshots were taken.
The repository must have a <code class="literal">uuid</code> field, which is supported only in Elasticsearch versions 7.12.0 and higher. If the cluster was created with a previous version and later upgraded to 7.12.0 or higher, the repository may not have the required <code class="literal">uuid</code> field and therefore cannot be used to restore onto another cluster.</p>
<p>To be sure, you can send a <code class="literal">GET /_snapshot/found-snapshots</code> request to your Elasticsearch cluster and check if the <code class="literal">uuid</code> field is present.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>The destination cluster must be version 7.13.2 or higher.</p>
<p>Previous versions had issues restoring the snapshot or recovering searchable snapshot indices in case of, for example, node failure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The snapshot in the source cluster cannot be deleted after being successfully restored in the destination cluster.
In fact, that&#8217;s also the case for the searchable snapshots in the source cluster for which there were indices backed by the restored snapshot. These snapshots are required for recovery of the searchable snapshot indices in case of, for example, node failure.</p>
<p>This means that until you delete the searchable snapshot indices in the destination cluster, you must not delete your source deployment, delete the restored snapshot, or delete any of the searchable snapshots used by the searchable snapshot indices.</p>
