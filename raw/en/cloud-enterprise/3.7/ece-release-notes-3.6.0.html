<p>The following changes are included in this release.</p>
<h3><a id="ece_features_3"></a>Features<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-105/docs/cloud-enterprise/releases/3.6.0/feature.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Private link support for better traffic management.</strong></span> Added a new API endpoint where organizations claim their private link (AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private Link, or GCP Private Service Connect). The owner of the private link uses the private link in traffic filtering, which reduces the risk of data exfiltration.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong><code class="literal">xpack.security.transport.ssl.trust_restrictions.x509_fields</code> on allow list.</strong></span> Adds <code class="literal">xpack.security.transport.ssl.trust_restrictions.x509_fields</code> to allowed user settings for supported stack versions.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Restore component IDs to the UI.</strong></span> The IDs for Kibana, APM, Fleet and Enterprise Search are accessible in the UI again.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add <code class="literal">ingest_pipeline</code> metricset to Elasticsearch monitoring.</strong></span> Enables shipping ingest pipeline metrics for Elasticsearch when Logs &amp; Metrics is enabled. Requires Elastic Stack v8.7.0 and above.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Support Elasticsearch plugins built against the stable plugin API.</strong></span> Support for Elasticsearch plugins built against the stable plugin API that is introduced in Elasticsearch 8.7.0.
If the stable plugin API is used, a plugin should contain <code class="literal">stable-plugin-descriptor.properties</code>.
If a plugin contains both <code class="literal">plugin-descriptor.properties</code> and <code class="literal">stable-plugin-descriptor.properties</code>, the behavior is undefined.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Latest agent versions url addition 8.8.</strong></span> Includes <code class="literal">xpack.apm.latestAgentVersionsUrl</code> APM configuration setting for 8.8 as part of last agent versions feature.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Support for role based access control roles with SSO.</strong></span> In Elastic Cloud Enterprise a Deployments viewer and Deployments manager can SSO into a deployment from the Elastic Cloud Enterprise UI.</p>
<h3><a id="ece_enhancements_2"></a>Enhancements<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-105/docs/cloud-enterprise/releases/3.6.0/enhancement.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Cloud Enterprise now comes with 7.17.10.</strong></span> Elastic Cloud Enterprise now comes with 7.17.10 out of the box.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Improved local trust management.</strong></span> Allows users to download the certificate for all of their <code class="literal">local</code> trust relationships.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Machine learning vCPU improvements.</strong></span> Displaying the minimum vCPU values for your machine learning instance.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Discard invalid external trusts which have been deleted.</strong></span> Whenever a deployment had an external trust that referenced a platform level trust which had been deleted from the platform page, the deployment page would show just the ID number and this had to be deleted before making any other edits to the settings. These are now filtered out so they are automatically cleaned up on the next edit.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>A non-high-availability health indicator added.</strong></span> A new health indicator for non-high-availability Elasticsearch clusters has been added when the Elasticsearch hot, warm, and/or cold tiers have 1 availability zone only.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Kibana display native memory.</strong></span> Native memory pressures for Kibana instances are now displayed.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Snapshot restore improvements.</strong></span> Added an option to disable <code class="literal">extended maintenance</code> on a snapshot restore from another deployment.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>New JWT realm settings for supporting access tokens.</strong></span> Enhanced the JWT realm to support specific access tokens.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Upgrade Beats to 7.17.9 and close file handle in IndexTemplatesProvider.</strong></span> Upgrades bundled Beats to 7.17.9.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong><code class="literal">trace.id</code> added to proxy request logs.</strong></span> <code class="literal">trace.id</code> is now included in the header in Proxy request logs for easier debugging.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Show release notes links in the upgrade modal.</strong></span> Links to release notes are now provided in the Upgrade Modal for the selected version.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Table view added for deployment instances.</strong></span> Added a table view for viewing an individual deployment&#8217;s instances. Find it on the right side of the filter bar.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Log manipulated <code class="literal">X-Opaque-Id</code> header for Kibana requests.</strong></span> Add Kibana execution context derived from <code class="literal">X-Opaque-Id</code> header to Proxy request logs.</p>
<h3><a id="ece_bug_fixes_2"></a>Bug fixes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-105/docs/cloud-enterprise/releases/3.6.0/bug.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Enable plugins on existing deployments.</strong></span> Previously there was an issue where users could not enable plugins on existing deployments.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Include <code class="literal">query_paramers</code> field in Adminconsole logs.</strong></span> Adds query parameters to the Cloud API logs redacting key fields.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Improve instance health checker.</strong></span> In case deployment stack resource instances (Elasticsearch/Kibana/APM instances) are removed (when a deployment is terminated or deleted) and a user checks deployment health, then a wrong indicator is shown saying instances are unhealthy. It should show that the instances are missing. The stack names are used in the indicator summary as <code class="literal">Enterprise_search</code>, <code class="literal">Integration_server</code>. The stack names are now correctly <code class="literal">Enterprise Search</code>, <code class="literal">Integration Server</code>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Expose <code class="literal">nameid_format</code> as a configurable attribute for ECE SAML.</strong></span> <code class="literal">nameid_format</code> is a configurable attribute when creating or modifying a SAML configuration on ECE.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Convert <code class="literal">int_server</code> to APM when vacating those nodes from the deployment page.</strong></span> Fixes a bug whereby Integrations Server instances were not able to be moved from one allocator to another, if the action was taken from the Deployment page.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>The helper function now takes into account the current plan.</strong></span> Fixes bug where removing a topology element in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> page would lead to a warning about elements already existing in the deployment. This was a false positive.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Rename JVM keystore configs in Elasticsearch cluster data.</strong></span> The <code class="literal">trust.jvm_trust_store</code> and <code class="literal">trust.jvm_store_pass</code> Elasticsearch cluster data settings were renamed to <code class="literal">jvm_trust_store.name</code> and <code class="literal">jvm_trust_store.password</code>, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Restore forecast window field.</strong></span> The forecast window should again be selectable for a deployment&#8217;s Hot data and Content tier.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Refactor pagination sorting.</strong></span> Fixes a bug where sorting on the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Deployments List</strong></span> page was only working for the items on a single page. If you had more than 30 deployments, the sorting on the table view would only sort the items on that page. Now sorting works for all deployments.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Prevent deleting the data-stream if it exists while creating the data-stream.</strong></span> Previously a function to create a data stream was introduced. Inside this function, if the data stream existed already it was deleted. Deleting the data stream also deleted the underlying indices which meant all existing monitoring data was lost.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Rename endpoint for calling Elasticsearch Health API.</strong></span> These changes rename the endpoint that the Deployment Health API uses to invoke the Elasticsearch Health API from <code class="literal">_health</code> to <code class="literal">_health_report</code> for deployments &gt;= 8.7.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Restore re-apply button for changed sources.</strong></span> Fixes an issue where the "re-apply" button was not showing for user-initiated plan changes.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Revert instance configuration defaults.</strong></span> Fixes a bug whereby in ECE users weren&#8217;t able to create an instance configuration with the default values.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Deployments List health filters to allow selecting multiple values.</strong></span> Users are now able to select multiple health filters on the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Deployments List</strong></span> page.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Deployment template creation on logs/metrics page automatically sending monitoring data.</strong></span> Fixes a bug that didn&#8217;t allow users to deselect sending monitoring data of either logs or metrics.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Missing user plugin.</strong></span> Fixes a bug where Elasticsearch instances would silently ignore a user plugin that failed to download at boot time. Behavior is now corrected to keep retrying until success.</p>
<h3><a id="ece_deprecations"></a>Deprecations<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-105/docs/cloud-enterprise/releases/3.6.0/deprecation.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Remove all v0 coordinator routes.</strong></span> CRUD operations with the coordinators using the <code class="literal">api/v0/coordinators</code> endpoint are now replaced with the equivalent v1 endpoint <code class="literal">api/v1/platform/infrastructure/coordinators</code>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Migrate EULA accept endpoint to v1.</strong></span> Deprecated <code class="literal">v0/users/eula/_accept</code> endpoint is now available as <code class="literal">v1/platform/license/eula/_accept</code>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Deprecate settings to change Elasticsearch/Kibana used by stateless components.</strong></span> Deprecating deployment configuration settings that allow overriding the
Elasticsearch and Kibana endpoints.</p>
<p>These settings allow you to change the Elasticsearch used by Kibana. If you remove these settings, you can no longer override the provisioned Elasticsearch that remains in use in the same deployment.</p>
<p>This affects the following fields in the create-deployment and update-deployment APIs:</p>
