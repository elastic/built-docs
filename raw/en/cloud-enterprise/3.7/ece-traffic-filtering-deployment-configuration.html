<p>Traffic filtering is one of the security layers available in Elastic Cloud Enterprise. It allows you to limit how your deployments can be accessed. Add another layer of security to your installation and deployments by restricting inbound traffic to <em>only</em> the sources that you trust.</p>
<p>Elastic Cloud Enterprise supports the following traffic sources:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="ece-traffic-filtering-ip.html" title="IP traffic filters">IP addresses and Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) masks</a>, e.g. <code class="literal">82.102.25.74</code> or <code class="literal">199.226.244.0/24</code>.

<a class="xref" href="ece-enable-ccs.html" title="Enable cross-cluster search and cross-cluster replication">Remote cluster connections</a>, using organization and Elasticsearch cluster IDs for securing cross-cluster operations.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Filtering rules are grouped into rule sets, which in turn are associated with one or more deployments to take effect. Traffic between the instances in your deployment is automatically allowed.</p>
<p>Traffic filter operates on the proxy. Requests rejected by the traffic filter are not forwarded to the deployment. The proxy responds to the client with <code class="literal">403 Forbidden</code>.</p>

<div class="admon_content">
<p>Domain-based filtering rules are not allowed for Cloud traffic filtering, because the original IP is hidden behind the proxy. Only IP-based filtering rules are allowed.</p>

<h3><a id="ece-traffic-filter-how-does-it-work"></a>How does it work?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-105/docs/shared/ec-ce-traffic-filtering-deployment-configuration.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>By default, all your deployments are accessible over the public internet, assuming that your Elastic Cloud Enterprise proxies are accessible.</p>
<p>Once you associate at least one traffic filter with a deployment, traffic that does not match any rules (for this deployment) is denied.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>This only applies to external traffic. Internal traffic is managed by Elastic Cloud Enterprise. For example, Kibana can connect to Elasticsearch, as well as internal services which manage the deployment. Other deployments can&#8217;t connect to deployments protected by traffic filters.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can assign multiple rule sets to a single deployment. The rule sets can be of  different types.</p>
<p>In case of multiple rule sets, traffic can match ANY of them. If none of the rule sets match the request is rejected with <code class="literal">403 Forbidden</code>.</p>
<p>You can mark a rule set as <em>default</em>. It is automatically attached to all new deployments that you create in its region. You can detach default rule sets from deployments after they are created.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>A <em>default</em> rule set is not automatically attached to existing deployments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For more information about creating and editing rule sets and then associating them with your deployments, check <a class="xref" href="ece-traffic-filtering-ip.html" title="IP traffic filters">IP addresses and CIDR masks</a>.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Traffic filter rule sets when associated with a deployment will apply to all deployment endpoints, such as Elasticsearch, Kibana, APM Server, and others.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Any traffic filter rule set assigned to a deployment overrides the default behavior of <em>allow all access over the public internet endpoint; deny all access over Private Link</em>. The implication is that if you make a mistake putting in the traffic source (for example, specified the wrong IP address) the deployment will be effectively locked down to any of your traffic. You can use the UI to adjust or remove the rule sets.</p>

<p>Jane creates a deployment. At this point the deployment is accessible over internet through its public endpoint, e.g. <code class="literal">https://fcd41689e9214319b1278325fd6af7cd.us-east-1.aws.found.io</code>. The deployment is protected by username+password authentication, but there&#8217;s no additional traffic source filtering.</p>
<p>Jane wants to allow access to the deployment from Jane&#8217;s Office.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
They create an IP rule set with office IP range give as a CIDR mask, e.g. <code class="literal">199.226.244.0/24</code>.

They attach the rule set to the deployment.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The deployment is accessible from the CIDR range from Jane&#8217;s Office.

<p>Later, Jane decides to allow anyone to connect to the deployment over the public internet.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">

<p>Requests rejected by traffic filter have status code <code class="literal">403 Forbidden</code> and response body <code class="literal">{"ok":false,"message":"Forbidden"}</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, traffic filter rejections are logged in the proxy logs as <code class="literal">status_reason: BLOCKED_BY_IP_FILTER</code>.</p>
<p>Proxy logs also provide client IP in <code class="literal">client_ip</code> field.</p>
