<p>New for Elastic Cloud Enterprise version 2.0.0:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Changed username for all new installations of ECE.</strong></span> You should now use <code class="literal">admin</code> as the username for the user that is created during installation. For installations upgraded from 1.x, the <code class="literal">root</code> user is still available until the next major version; all new 2.x installations have only the <code class="literal">admin</code> and <code class="literal">readonly</code> users.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>New deployment templates for the Elastic Stack.</strong></span> Deploy the Elastic Stack using our new deployment templates. These flexible, customizable templates are designed to fit your use case better, whether it&#8217;s search, logging or whatever challenge you can think up for Elastic Cloud Enterprise.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>New customizable deployment templates for your hardware.</strong></span> Create your own deployment templates that are designed to work with your hardware. By first creating instance configurations that tell ECE what kind of hardware you have, you can provide the building blocks that you can then create deployment templated from. Create your own templates that are optimized for I/O, CPU, memory, and storage to match your use case.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>New machine learning capabilities.</strong></span> Add machine learning to your deployments to gain insight and predict anomalies. Previously available for the Elastic Stack on-prem, now supported on Elastic Cloud Enterprise.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Machine learning requires Elasticsearch version 6.3.1 or later, but you can upgrade your deployment to a supported version first and then add machine learning.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>New hot-warm architecture with index lifecycle management.</strong></span> Quickly ingest and query current data, while keeping older data around on more cost-effective storage. If you need a complete logging solution, this is it.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Additional Kibana deployment capabilities.</strong></span> Deploy Kibana across multiple availability zones with your Elasticsearch cluster and scale Kibana to whatever size you need.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>New dedicated master nodes.</strong></span> Improve the resilience of your deployments by adding dedicated master nodes. Larger-scale deployments get them automatically.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Additional snapshot interval configuration.</strong></span> Quickly change your snapshot interval using the Cloud UI.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Better networking and ports guidance.</strong></span> Need a better understanding of how our products communicate with each other and on which ports? Check out our improved  <a class="xref" href="ece-prereqs-networking.html" title="Networking">ECE networking and ports</a> page.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>New night mode capability.</strong></span> Enjoy our new night mode in the Cloud UI. UI too bright when you want to focus on work? Try the night mode, available in the Cloud UI.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Improved security for Elasticsearch clusters and Kibana instances.</strong></span> To secure your Elasticsearch clusters and Kibana instances, use a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) identity provider (IdP) for cross-domain, single sign-on authentication.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Support for installing ECE on Ubuntu 16.04 using Docker 18.03.</strong></span> Docker 1.13 is still supported, but now users that wish to use a newer Docker version have an upgrade path.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Support for full encryption.</strong></span> Full encryption is supported for all internal network traffic, including traffic between nodes in a cluster, and between proxies, clusters, and all internal services.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As before, you can manage hosted Elasticsearch and Kibana from our Cloud UI. Our UI might look different with its new sliders, but your existing deployments will continue to work exactly as before.</p>
<p>To upgrade to Elastic Cloud Enterprise version 2.0.0, see <a class="xref" href="ece-upgrade.html" title="Upgrade your installation">Upgrade Your Installation</a>.
After you complete the upgrade, <a class="xref" href="ece-configuring-ece-templates.html" title="Configure deployment templates">configure deployment templates</a> for ECE to indicate what kind of hardware you have available for Elastic Stack deployments.</p>
<h3><a id="ece_known_problems_or_limitations_2"></a>Known problems or limitations<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/release-ms-41/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-release-notes.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The following known problems or limitations exist for ECE 2.0:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You cannot convert Elastic Stack deployments between templates. For example: A deployment created with the default template cannot be converted to a hot-warm template. You can work around this limitation by creating a new deployment with the template you want and restoring your data using a snapshot from the original deployment.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
This version of ECE is known to have a problem with snapshot storage integrations, breaking support for Minio (when using the Elastic Stack 6.4.2 or later), Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and Microsoft Azure Storage. Except for Microsoft Azure Storage, these storage integrations are available again in ECE 2.1 and we recommend that you upgrade to this later version. A possible workaround to reenable Microsoft Azure Storage is still being investigated. After upgrading to ECE 2.1, you might also need to upgrade your deployments to the Elastic Stack 6.5.0 or later to reenable snapshot storage support.
