<p>New for Elastic Cloud Enterprise 2.5.0:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Dedicated coordinating nodes.</strong></span> Your Elasticsearch cluster now supports nodes that take care solely of the coordination of incoming read and write requests. These coordinating nodes relieve master and data nodes, improving the resilience of your Elasticsearch cluster.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Snapshot lifecycle management (SLM).</strong></span> Beginning with Elastic Stack version 7.6, you now use Kibana to manage your snapshots. In Kibana, you can set up additional repositories where the snapshots are stored, other than the one currently managed by Elastic Cloud Enterprise. You can view and delete snapshots, and configure a snapshot lifecycle management (SLM) policy to automate when snapshots are created and deleted. <a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.10/snapshot-repositories.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Index curation to index lifecycle management (ILM) migration.</strong></span> If you are using index curation with the Elastic Stack version 6.7 and later, you can now migrate to index lifecycle management with a few clicks. During the migration, we create your ILM policies and associate the required index templates for you. Since index curation is deprecated and will be removed in the next major Elastic Stack version, you should migrate and take advantage of the robust feature set of ILM. <a class="xref" href="ece-migrate-index-management.html" title="Migrate to index lifecycle management">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Custom Kibana plugins</strong></span>. If you’d like to leverage Kibana’s extension points to use a custom visualization or build a new Kibana app, you can now write your own custom plugin or use one of the existing plugins.</p>
<p>As part of this release, we published a step-by-step guide about how to add your custom Kibana plugins in ECE stack packs, giving you control over which plugins are installed. You&#8217;ll need to verify that the plugin is compatible with the stack pack version. Then, you can add the plugin to the stack pack, repackage the stack pack, and upload it to make it available to your users and teams. The plugin will be installed automatically in deployments created using that stack pack.</p>
<p>This functionality is supported starting for ECE 2.0 and later with the Elastic Stack 6.8 and later. <a class="xref" href="ece-include-additional-kibana-plugin.html" title="Include additional Kibana plugins">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a></p>

<p>Elastic Cloud Enterprise 2.5.0 includes the following bug fix:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Upgrade Elasticsearch in deployments with App Search to versions 7.7+.</strong></span> You can now upgrade your Elasticsearch cluster in a deployment that contains App Search even though App Search is no longer present in stack versions 7.7 and higher.

<h3><a id="ece-release-notes-2.5.0-known-problems"></a>Known problems<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/release-ms-41/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-release-notes.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>This version of ECE has a known problem when you upgrade Elasticsearch to stack versions 7.7 and higher in a deployment with App Search. App Search is no longer present in those stack versions and will be replaced by Enterprise Search, which will be available in an upcoming minor version of Elastic Cloud Enterprise. After you upgrade, the deployment will continue to work as expected but the App Search navigation tab might disappear. To access App Search, modify the deployment URL in your browser to add <code class="literal">appsearch</code> to it.</p>
<p>For example, to use App Search change the URL <code class="literal">https://cloud.elastic.co/deployments/b0b1a680a9334113a2fee3fbd67b7ce5</code> to <code class="literal">https://cloud.elastic.co/deployments/b0b1a680a9334113a2fee3fbd67b7ce5/appsearch</code></p>
<p>ECE versions 2.5 are affected.</p>
<p>All App Search versions from 7.5 to 7.6 have a bug in which the <code class="literal">system.log</code> file is not rotated.</p>
<p><em>Release date: April 14, 2020</em></p>
