<p>New for Elastic Cloud Enterprise 2.7.0:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>New logging features.</strong></span> You can now supplement your deployment monitoring by shipping logs to a monitoring deployment. The new functionality makes extra logging features available, including audit logging, and lets you search and analyze your deployment logs in Kibana. To get started, see <a class="xref" href="ece-enable-logging-and-monitoring.html" title="Enable logging and monitoring">Enable logging and monitoring</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Stack 7.10.0</strong></span>. This version of Elastic Cloud Enterprise is bundled with our latest Elastic Stack version. To learn more about best practices when upgrading deployments from previous versions of the Elastic Stack, see <a class="xref" href="ece-upgrade-deployment.html" title="Upgrade versions">Upgrade versions</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Automatic upgrade of some system clusters</strong></span>. Starting with this release, ECE now automatically upgrades the <code class="literal">admin-console-elasticsearch</code> and <code class="literal">security</code> clusters to the latest bundled 7.x version of Elasticsearch. Upgrading these system clusters provides access to new features and keeps these clusters up to date with the rest of the stack.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>SSO support for Enterprise Search.</strong></span> For Elastic Stack versions 7.9.2 and later, single sign-on (SSO) is now supported between your Elastic Cloud Enterprise account and Enterprise Search instances. Once you are authenticated to your Elastic Cloud Enterprise account, you no longer need to log in separately to access Enterprise Search. <a class="xref" href="ece-deployment-sso.html" title="Configure SSO for deployments">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Switch to session cookies for authentication</strong></span>. The Cloud UI now uses session cookies set by the API for authentication between client and server to improve security. In previous releases, the Cloud UI used JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) stored in <code class="literal">localStorage</code> for authentication.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Improved installation instructions</strong></span>. The ECE documentation is now simplified and repurposed into clearer paths for each installation option:</p>

<h3><a id="ece_whats_changed"></a>What&#8217;s changed<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-47/docs/cloud-enterprise/ce-release-notes.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
We changed the type used for optimistic concurrency version fields in OpenAPI specification from an integer to a string. This is necessary for the <code class="literal">admin-console-elasticsearch</code> cluster to be upgraded to Elasticsearch 7, which uses a 2 part primary term + sequence number versioning scheme. This does not change the API itself, but it requires changes in your code if you are using a client generated from our OpenAPI specification.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>This release runs Elasticsearch 7.9.2 or later with the <code class="literal">XX:ActiveProcessorCount</code> JVM flag instead of the <code class="literal">node.processors</code> setting that was used with previous versions. If you had already added an Elastic Stack pack for version 7.9.2 or later before upgrading to ECE 2.7, the following changes apply:</p>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The new <code class="literal">ActiveProcessorCount</code> JVM flag takes effect for Elasticsearch clusters on version 7.9.2 or later after the first instance reboot following the upgrade to ECE 2.7.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
You might notice a change in performance characteristics, but our tests have indicated the difference to be a net positive one for most scenarios. The main driver for this change is to ensure more predictable performance, as the previous mechanism was shown to cause the JVM to make poor sizing choices for some of its internal thread pools.
