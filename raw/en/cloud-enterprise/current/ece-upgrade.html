<p>Periodically, you might need to upgrade an Elastic Cloud Enterprise installation as new versions with additional features become available. The upgrade process updates all hosts that are part of an Elastic Cloud Enterprise installation to the latest version of ECE, with little or no downtime for managed deployments.</p>
<p>Before initiating the ECE upgrade process, consult the <a href="/support/matrix" class="ulink" target="_top">OS &amp; Docker supportability matrix</a> to make sure that the Operating System (OS) and Docker versions you run are compatible with the ECE version you&#8217;re about to upgrade to.
We recommend that Docker and the operating system be at the target version before starting the ECE upgrade procedure.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>During the upgrade window, there might be a short time you are on a mix of versions which is not declared explicitly in the support matrix. For example, if you are on ECE 3.5 with Docker version 20.10 on Ubuntu 20.04, and plan to upgrade to ECE 3.7 on same OS, you will need to upgrade Docker to version 24.0 first. In this case, <span class="strong strong"><strong>only during your upgrade window</strong></span>, we support the mixed OS/Docker versions. In general, this won&#8217;t be a problem, however, should anything become a blocker for the upgrade, please <a class="xref" href="ece-getting-help.html" title="Ask for help">reach out to support for help</a>.</p>

<p>Upgrading Elastic Cloud Enterprise works by replacing the <a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack-glossary/current/terms.html#glossary-container" class="ulink" target="_top">containers</a> that ECE itself requires to run on each host.
Upgrading ECE does not touch any of the containers that run Elasticsearch clusters and Kibana instances. Each container that needs to be upgraded is renamed and stopped, followed by the creation of a new container with an upgraded instance of the ECE software and its dependencies. When the upgrade process has completed successfully, it cleans up after itself and removes the old containers.</p>
<p>The upgrade process creates a <code class="literal">frc-upgraders-monitor</code> container on the host where you initiate the process that performs the following actions:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Back up the ZooKeeper transaction log to <code class="literal">HOST_STORAGE_PATH/RUNNER_ID/services/zookeeper/data/backup</code>, where <code class="literal">HOST_STORAGE_PATH</code> and <code class="literal">RUNNER_ID</code> are specific to an ECE installation.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Configure Elastic Cloud Enterprise to perform the individual container upgrades by creating a <code class="literal">frc-upgraders-upgrader</code> container on each host that is part of the installation.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Monitor the upgrade process to ensure that all <code class="literal">frc-upgraders-upgrader</code> containers perform their part of the upgrade as expected and report their status.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
After all hosts have been upgraded successfully, clean up temporary artifacts created during the upgrade process, and remove the old containers.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The entire process is designed to be failsafe.  Containers get upgraded sequentially and the upgrade status of each container is tracked. The upgrade process also monitors that each new container is viable and continues to run as expected. If there is an issue with any part of the upgrade, <a class="xref" href="ece-issues.html#ece-troubleshooting-upgrade" title="Upgrade failures">the entire process is rolled back</a>.</p>

<p>Before starting the upgrade process, check which of the following recommendations may apply for your setup:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Upgrading to 2.12.x or 2.13.0 is not recommended as it can cause issues and you may lose access to the admin console. You are strongly advised to upgrade to 2.13.1 and later.
</li>

If you are upgrading to ECE versions 2.10, 2.11, or 2.12, refer to the ECE version 2.12 <a href="/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/2.12/ece-upgrade.html#ece-upgrade-system-deployments" class="ulink" target="_top">upgrade steps</a> for guidance about certain default ECE visualizations not working.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
We strongly recommend that you routinely update your ECE installation to the most current version so that any bugs and security issues are fixed promptly. If you need to upgrade but are currently experiencing any issues with your platform, note that as long as ZooKeeper is running and healthy you should be able to upgrade (you can use the <a class="xref" href="get-runners.html" title="Get runners">get runners API</a> to easily verify the health of the runners on the <a class="xref" href="ece-architecture.html#ece-architecture-allocators" title="Allocators">ECE allocators</a>).

<p>Don&#8217;t manually upgrade your system deployments if you are on ECE version 2.7.0 or a later version, as it can cause issues and you may lose access to the Cloud UI.

If there are system deployments below version 6.8 or an ECE installation below version 2.7.0, refer to the ECE version 2.7 documentation for the steps to <a href="/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/2.7/ece-upgrade.html#ece-upgrade-system-deployments" class="ulink" target="_top">upgrade your system deployments</a>. Starting with ECE 2.7, all system deployments are upgraded automatically to their latest supported Elasticsearch version as part of the ECE upgrade process. This means that each system deployment can be upgraded to different major versions. For example, the security cluster could be upgraded to 8.x, while the admin and logging-and-metrics clusters could be upgraded to the latest 7.17.x version.

When upgrading from an ECE version between 2.0 and 2.4 included, we recommend to upgrade to ECE 2.5 first, then to manually upgrade system deployments to version 6.8.

If you are upgrading to ECE 3.6.0, you need to ensure that your system deployments are at version 7.17 because the upgrade process will attempt to upgrade the security cluster to 8.5 or higher. Starting with ECE 3.6.1, the upgrade process automatically upgrades system deployments to the minimum required version. If the Elastic Cloud Enterprise platform was upgraded successfully and yet one or more system deployments were not upgraded to a higher Elastic Stack version during the very last phase of the Elastic Cloud Enterprise upgrade, you can re-run the <code class="literal">elastic-cloud-enterprise.sh upgrade --cloud-enterprise-version &lt;your target version&gt;</code> command to retry system deployment upgrade only.

<span class="strong strong"><strong>Check the security cluster&#8217;s zone count</strong></span> Due to internal limitations in ECE, the built-in security cluster cannot be scaled to two zones during the ECE upgrade procedure.

<p>If your ECE installation is still using the default, auto-generated certificates, we recommend performing one of the following steps to avoid trust errors related to the proxy server certificate after the upgrade. The proxy server certificate is used when connecting to Kibana and Elasticsearch clusters. During the upgrade, the ECE certificate authority generates a new certificate. As with any server certificate rotation, you must add an exception for the new proxy server certificate, unless the certificate authority is present in the trust store of the system or browser. You can perform either of these steps before or after the upgrade:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Recommended: <a class="xref" href="ece-manage-certificates.html" title="Manage security certificates">Add your organization&#8217;s own certificate</a> to Elastic Cloud Enterprise. The upgrade process ensures that the certificates you add do not change, which avoids the trust errors.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Add the default CA certificate to the trust store of your system or of your browser. Only the server certificate changes during upgrade, but the CA certificate remains the same. Adding the CA certificate to your trust store alone is sufficient to avoid the trust errors.

<p>Apply valid license. It is required to have an <code class="literal">Enterprise resource unit</code>-compatible license applied before upgrading to ECE 2.7+. The most reliable way to check if your license is compatible is to use the Elastic Cloud Enterprise API and check the value of the license version field:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sh">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sh">curl -X GET -u admin:PASSWORD -k https://COORDINATOR_HOST:12443/api/v1/platform/license
{
  "license": {
    "version": 4,
    // other fields
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>If the version is not 4 or higher, you must request an updated license from <a class="xref" href="ece-getting-help.html" title="Ask for help">Elastic Support</a>. Once you receive your new license, make sure Elastic Cloud Enterprise is upgraded to at least version 2.5.0, and then upload the new license in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> page under the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Platform</strong></span> menu.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In versions from 2.6 to 2.10 included, some or all platform certificates are generated with a 398-day expiration. Installations that ran on these versions, even temporarily, must have their certificates rotated manually before expiry.
