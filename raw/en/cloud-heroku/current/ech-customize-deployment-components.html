<p>When you create or edit an existing deployment, you can fine-tune the capacity, add extensions, and select additional features.</p>
<h4><a id="ech-customize-autoscaling"></a>Autoscaling<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-110/docs/saas/ec-configuring.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Autoscaling reduces some of the manual effort required to manage a deployment by adjusting the capacity as demands on the deployment change. Currently, autoscaling is supported to scale Elasticsearch data tiers upwards, and to scale machine learning nodes both upwards and downwards. Check <a class="xref" href="ech-autoscaling.html" title="Deployment autoscaling">Deployment autoscaling</a> to learn more.</p>
<h4><a id="ech-cluster-size"></a>Elasticsearch<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-110/docs/saas/ec-configuring.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Depending upon how much data you have and what queries you plan to run, you need to select a cluster size that fits your needs. There is no silver bullet for deciding how much memory you need other than simply testing it. The <a class="xref" href="ech-monitoring.html" title="Monitoring your deployment">cluster performance metrics</a> in the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&amp;placement=docs-body" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku console</a> can tell you if your cluster is sized appropriately. You can also <a class="xref" href="ech-enable-logging-and-monitoring.html" title="Enable logging and monitoring">enable deployment monitoring</a> for more detailed performance metrics. Fortunately, you can change the amount of memory allocated to the cluster later without any downtime for HA deployments.</p>
<p>To change a cluster&#8217;s topology, from deployment management, select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Edit deployment</strong></span> from the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Actions</strong></span> dropdown. Next, select a storage and RAM setting from the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Size per zone</strong></span> drop-down list, and save your changes. When downsizing the cluster, make sure to have enough resources to handle the current load, otherwise your cluster will be under stress.</p>

</div>
<p>Currently, half the memory is assigned to the JVM heap (a bit less when monitoring is activated). For example, on a 32 GB cluster, 16 GB are allotted to heap. The disk-to-RAM ratio currently is 1:24, meaning that you get 24 GB of storage space for each 1 GB of RAM. All clusters are backed by SSD drives.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>For production systems, we recommend not using less than 4 GB of RAM for your cluster, which assigns 2 GB to the JVM heap.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The CPU resources assigned to a cluster are relative to the size of your cluster, meaning that a 32 GB cluster gets twice as much CPU resources as a 16 GB cluster. All clusters are guaranteed their share of CPU resources, as we do not overcommit resources. Smaller clusters up to and including 8 GB of RAM benefit from temporary CPU boosting to improve performance when needed most.</p>
<h4><a id="ech-high-availability"></a>Fault tolerance<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-110/docs/saas/ec-configuring.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>High availability is achieved by running a cluster with replicas in multiple data centers (availability zones), to prevent against downtime when infrastructure problems occur or when resizing or upgrading deployments. We offer the options of running in one, two, or three data centers.</p>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ec-fault-tolerance.png" alt="High availability features">
</div>
</div>
<p>Running in two data centers or availability zones is our default high availability configuration. It provides reasonably high protection against infrastructure failures and intermittent network problems. You might want three data centers if you need even higher fault tolerance. Just one zone might be sufficient, if the cluster is mainly used for testing or development.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Some <a class="xref" href="ech-reference-regions.html" title="Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku regions">regions</a> might have only two availability zones.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Like many other changes, you change the level of fault tolerance while the cluster is running. For example, when you prepare a new cluster for production use, you can first run it in a single data center and then add another data center right before deploying to production.</p>
<p>While multiple data centers or availability zones increase a cluster&#8217;s fault tolerance, they do not protect against problematic searches that cause nodes to run out of memory. For a cluster to be highly reliable and available, it is also important to <a class="xref" href="ech-metrics-memory-pressure.html" title="How does high memory pressure affect performance?">have enough memory</a>.</p>
<p>The node capacity you choose is per data center. The reason for this is that there is no point in having two data centers if the failure of one will result in a cascading error because the remaining data center cannot handle the total load. Through the allocation awareness in Elasticsearch, we configure the nodes so that your Elasticsearch cluster will automatically allocate replicas between each availability zone.</p>

<p>Lists the official plugins available for your selected Elasticsearch version, as well as any custom plugins and user bundles with dictionaries or scripts.</p>
<p>The reason we do not list the version chosen on this page is because we reserve the option to change it when necessary. That said, we will not force a cluster restart for a simple plugin upgrade unless there are severe issues with the current version. In most cases, plugin upgrades are applied lazily, in other words when something else forces a restart like you changing the plan or Elasticsearch runs out of memory.</p>

<div class="admon_content">
<p>If you use a version before 5.0 or if your deployment didn&#8217;t include a Kibana instance initially, there might not be a Kibana endpoint URL shown, yet. To enable Kibana, select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enable</strong></span>. Enabling Kibana provides you with an endpoint URL, where you can access Kibana. It can take a short while to provision Kibana right after you select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enable</strong></span>, so if you get an error message when you first access the endpoint URL, try again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Selecting <span class="strong strong"><strong>Open</strong></span> will log you in to Kibana using single sign-on (SSO).

<p>In maintenance mode, requests to your cluster are blocked during configuration changes. You use maintenance mode to perform corrective actions that might otherwise be difficult to complete. Maintenance mode lasts for the duration of a configuration change and is turned off after the change completes.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you use maintenance mode when your cluster is overwhelmed by requests and you need to increase capacity. If your cluster is being overwhelmed because it is undersized for its workload, nodes might not respond to efforts to resize. Putting the cluster into maintenance mode as part of the configuration change can stop the cluster from becoming completely unresponsive during the configuration change, so that you can resolve the capacity issue. Without this option, configuration changes for clusters that are overwhelmed can take longer and are more likely to fail.</p>
