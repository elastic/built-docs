<p>The deployment logging and monitoring feature lets you monitor your deployment in <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.6/introduction.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana</a> by shipping logs and metrics to a monitoring deployment. You can:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
View your deployment&#8217;s health and performance in real time and analyze past cluster, index, and node metrics.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
View your deployment&#8217;s logs to debug issues, discover slow queries, surface deprecations, and analyze access to your deployment.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Monitoring consists of two components:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
A monitoring and logging agent that is installed on each node in your deployment. The agents collect and index metrics to Elasticsearch, either on the same deployment or by sending logs and metrics to an external monitoring deployment. Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku manages the installation and configuration of the monitoring agent for you, and you should not modify any of the settings.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The stack monitoring application in Kibana that visualizes the monitoring metrics through a dashboard and the logs application that allows you to search and analyze deployment logs.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The steps in this section cover only the enablement of the monitoring and logging features in Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku. For more information on how to use the monitoring features, refer to the following documentation:</p>

<p>Some limitations apply when you use monitoring on Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku. To learn more, check the monitoring <a class="xref" href="ech-restrictions-monitoring.html" title="Restrictions and limitations">restrictions and limitations</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="ech-logging-and-monitoring-production"></a>Monitoring for production use<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-84/docs/shared/ec-ce-enable-logging-and-monitoring.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>For production use, you should send your deployment logs and metrics to a dedicated monitoring deployment. Monitoring indexes logs and metrics into Elasticsearch and these indexes consume storage, memory, and CPU cycles like any other index. By using a separate monitoring deployment, you avoid affecting your other production deployments and can view the logs and metrics even when a production deployment is unavailable.</p>
<p>How many monitoring deployments you use depends on your requirements:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You can ship logs and metrics for many deployments to a single monitoring deployment, if your business requirements permit it.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Although monitoring will work with a deployment running a single node, you need a minimum of three monitoring nodes to make monitoring highly available.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>You might need to create dedicated monitoring deployments for isolation purposes in some cases. For example:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
If you have many deployments and some of them are much larger than others, creating separate monitoring deployments prevents a large deployment from potentially affecting monitoring performance for smaller deployments.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you need to silo Elasticsearch data for different business departments. Deployments that have been configured to ship logs and metrics to a target monitoring deployment have access to indexing data and can manage monitoring index templates, which is addressed by creating separate monitoring deployments.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Logs and metrics that get sent to a dedicated monitoring Elasticsearch deployment <a class="xref" href="ech-enable-logging-and-monitoring.html#ech-logging-and-monitoring-retention" title="Retention of monitoring daily indices">may not be cleaned up automatically</a> and might require some additional steps to remove excess data periodically.</p>

<p>When you enable monitoring in Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku, your monitoring indices are retained

the monitoring indices are deleted automatically. The retention period

<p>When you enable self-monitoring in Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku, your monitoring indices are retained for a certain period by default. After the retention period has passed, the monitoring indices are deleted automatically. Monitoring data is retained for three days by default or as specified by the <a class="xref" href="ech-add-user-settings.html#xpack-monitoring-history-duration"><code class="literal">xpack.monitoring.history.duration</code> user setting</a>.</p>
<p>To retain monitoring indices as is without deleting them automatically, you must disable the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.6/local-exporter.html#local-exporter-cleaner" class="ulink" target="_top">cleaner service</a> by adding a disabled local exporter in your cluster settings.</p>

<p>When you enable monitoring in Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku by configuring your deployment <span class="strong strong"><strong>to send monitoring data to itself</strong></span>, your monitoring indices are retained for a certain period by default.
