<p>With your Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku subscription, you get access to support from the creators of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, Logstash, and much more. We&#8217;re here to help!</p>
<h3><a id="echhow_do_i_open_a_support_case"></a>How do I open a support case?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-92/docs/saas/ec-support.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>All roads lead to the Elastic Support Portal, where you can access to all your cases, subscriptions, and licenses.</p>
<p>As an Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku customer, you will receive an email with instructions how to log in to the Support Portal, where you can track both current and archived cases. If you are a new customer who just signed up for Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku, it can take a few hours for your Support Portal access to be set up. If you have questions, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:support@elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">support@elastic.co</a>.</p>
