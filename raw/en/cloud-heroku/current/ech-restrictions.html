<p>For limitations related to logging and monitoring, check the <a class="xref" href="ech-restrictions-monitoring.html" title="Restrictions and limitations">Restrictions and limitations</a> section of the logging and monitoring page.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we also publish information about <a class="xref" href="ech-restrictions.html#ech-known-problems" title="Known problems">Known problems</a> with our Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku or the Elastic Stack.</p>
<p>To learn more about the features that are supported by Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku, check <a href="/cloud/elasticsearch-service/subscriptions?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Cloud Subscriptions</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="ech-restrictions-heroku"></a>Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-88/docs/saas/ec-restrictions-known-problems.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Not all features of our Elasticsearch Service are available to Heroku users. Specifically, you cannot create additional deployments or use different deployment templates.</p>
<p>Generally, if a feature is shown as available in the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku console</a>, you can use it.</p>

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
File and LDAP realms cannot be used. The Native realm is enabled, but the realm configuration itself is fixed in Elastic Cloud. Alternatively, authentication protocols such as SAML, OpenID Connect, or Kerberos can be used.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Client certificates, such as PKI certificates, are not supported.

<h3><a id="ech-restrictions-transport-client"></a>Transport client<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-88/docs/saas/ec-restrictions-known-problems.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The transport client is not considered thread safe in a cloud environment. We recommend that you use the Java REST client instead. This restriction relates to the fact that your deployments hosted on Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku are behind proxies, which prevent the transport client from communicating directly with Elasticsearch clusters.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The transport client is not supported over <a class="xref" href="ech-traffic-filtering-vpc.html" title="AWS PrivateLink traffic filters">private link connections</a>. Use the Java REST client instead, or connect over the public internet.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The transport client does not work with Elasticsearch clusters at version 7.6 and later that are hosted on Cloud. Transport client continues to work with Elasticsearch clusters at version 7.5 and earlier. Note that the transport client was deprecated with version 7.0 and will be removed with 8.0.

<h3><a id="ech-restrictions-plugins"></a>Elasticsearch and Kibana plugins<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-88/docs/saas/ec-restrictions-known-problems.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Kibana plugins are not supported.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Elasticsearch plugins, are not enabled by default for security purposes. Please reach out to support if you would like to enable Elasticsearch plugins support on your account.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Some Elasticsearch plugins do not apply to Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku. For example, you won&#8217;t ever need to change discovery, as Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku handles how nodes discover one another.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
In Elasticsearch 5.0 and later, site plugins are no longer supported. This change does not affect the site plugins Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku might provide out of the box, such as Kopf or Head, since these site plugins are serviced by our proxies and not Elasticsearch itself.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
In Elasticsearch 5.0 and later, site plugins such as Kopf and Paramedic are no longer provided. We recommend that you use our <a class="xref" href="ech-monitoring.html" title="Keeping your deployment healthy">cluster performance metrics</a>, <a class="xref" href="ech-monitoring.html" title="Keeping your deployment healthy">X-Pack monitoring features</a> and Kibana&#8217;s (6.3+) <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.6/index-mgmt.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Index Management UI</a> if you want more detailed information or perform index management actions.

<p>Currently you cannot use SSO to login for Kibana endpoints that are protected by Private Link traffic filters. Authentication using the Elasticsearch username and password should work but only with <code class="literal">{kibana-id}.{vpce|privatelink|psc}.domain</code> URLs.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t set the Watcher webhook target to a deployment protected by traffic filters. This restriction also applies to <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.6/automating-report-generation.html#use-watcher" class="ulink" target="_top">generating PDFs</a> using Watcher. Public webhooks such as Slack, PagerDuty, and email are not affected by this limitation.</p>

<p>If you are using APM 7.9.0 or older:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You cannot use <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.6/agent-configuration.html" class="ulink" target="_top">APM Agent central configuration</a> if your deployment is secured by <a class="xref" href="ech-traffic-filtering-deployment-configuration.html" title="Traffic Filtering">traffic filters</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you access your APM deployment over <a class="xref" href="ech-traffic-filtering-vpc.html" title="AWS PrivateLink traffic filters">PrivateLink</a>, to use APM Agent central configuration you need to allow access to the APM deployment over public internet.

<p>If you are using Fleet 7.13.x:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You cannot use Fleet 7.13.x, if your deployment is secured by <a class="xref" href="ech-traffic-filtering-deployment-configuration.html" title="Traffic Filtering">traffic filters</a>. Fleet 7.14.0 and later works with traffic filters (both Private Link and IP filters).

<p>Enterprise Search&#8217;s management interface in Kibana does not work with traffic filters with 8.3.1 and older, it will return an <code class="literal">Insufficient permissions</code> (403 Forbidden) error. In Kibana 8.3.2, 8.4.0 and higher, the Enterprise Search management interface works with traffic filters.</p>
<h3><a id="ech-snapshot-restore-enterprise-search-kibana-across-deployments"></a>Restoring a snapshot across deployments<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-88/docs/saas/ec-restrictions-known-problems.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Kibana and Enterprise Search do not currently support restoring a snapshot of their indices across Elastic Cloud deployments.</p>
<p><a href="/guide/en/kibana/current/using-kibana-with-security.html#security-configure-settings" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana uses encryption keys</a> in various places, ranging from encrypting data in some areas of reporting, alerts, actions, connector tokens, ingest outputs used in Fleet and Synthetics monitoring to user sessions.</p>
<p><a href="/guide/en/enterprise-search/current/encryption-keys.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Enterprise Search uses encryption keys</a> when storing content source synchronization credentials, API tokens and other sensitive information.</p>
<p>Currently, there is not a way to retrieve the values of Kibana and Enterprise Search encryption keys, or set them in the target deployment before restoring a snapshot. As a result, once a snapshot is restored, Kibana and Enterprise Search will not be able to decrypt the data required for some Kibana and Enterprise Search features to function properly in the target deployment.</p>
<p>If you have already restored a snapshot across deployments and now have broken Kibana saved objects or Enterprise Search features in the target deployment, contact <a href="https://support.elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Support</a> for assistance.</p>

There is a known problem affecting clusters with versions 7.7.0 and 7.7.1 due to <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56739" class="ulink" target="_top">a bug in Elasticsearch</a>.
Although rare, this bug can prevent you from running plans. If this occurs we recommend that you retry the plan, and if that fails please contact support to get your plan through.
Because of this bug we recommend you to upgrade to version 7.8 and higher, where the problem has already been addressed.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
A known issue can prevent direct rolling upgrades from Elasticsearch version 5.6.10 to version 6.3.0.
