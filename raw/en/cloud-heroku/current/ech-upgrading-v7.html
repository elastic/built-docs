<p>If you have a cluster and want to upgrade to version 7.x, there are a few things you must do to prepare for the upgrade. Preparing for your upgrade ahead of time ensures that you can enjoy the new features and improved usability of Elasticsearch 7.x as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3><a id="echbefore_you_begin_7"></a>Before you begin<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-111/docs/shared/ec-ce-upgrading-v7.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku upgrades differ from your on-premise installation because all major configuration changes for Elasticsearch, Kibana, and the security features are handled for you.</p>
<p>When you upgrade, Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku automatically runs the deprecation API to retrieve information about the cluster, node, and index-level settings that need to be removed or changed. If there are any deprecation issues that would prevent the upgraded deployment from successfully performing, the upgrade fails. To resolve the deprecation issues, use the Upgrade Assistant in Kibana.</p>
<p>If your cluster does not include a Kibana instance yet, you can
<a class="xref" href="ech-enable-kibana2.html" title="Enable Kibana">enable Kibana first,</a>
then use the Upgrade Assistant. After you resolve the deprecation issues, try the upgrade again.</p>

<p>To keep your data safe, Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku takes a snapshot before making any changes to your cluster. After a major version upgrade is complete, and the first successful snapshot with the new major version is available, the snapshot taken with the previous version of Elasticsearch is either stored in your snapshot repository or listed under snapshots.</p>
<p>For example, before upgrading from Elasticsearch version 6.7 to version 7.x, a snapshot is taken. After the upgrade to version 7.x is complete, and a first snapshot with the new version is available, snapshots taken with version 6.7 is listed under snapshots.</p>

<p>Elasticsearch 7.x is compatible with indices created in version 6.0 or later. If you have indices from version 5.x or earlier, you must remove or reindex them before you upgrade.</p>

<p>Major version upgrades can include changes that expose the upgrading process to possible risk. A breaking change is the result of a functional change between major Elasticsearch versions, and requires you to perform additional steps to ensure that you can use the new version as intended.</p>

<p>The following known issues apply to the Elastic Stack 7.x releases:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
There are deprecated APIs that are still available for use. If you get warnings in the Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku logs about the deprecated APIs, you can ignore them.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku does not support the ability to upgrade to or from release candidate builds, such as 7.0.0-rc1.

</ul>

<p>When you upgrade from version 6.7 to 7.0, you must first <a class="xref" href="ech-access-kibana.html" title="Access Kibana">log in to Kibana</a> to make sure that your upgrade is successful.</p>

<p>During the upgrade process, you are prompted to update the security realm settings when your <code class="literal">user_settings</code> include a <code class="literal">xpack.security.authc.realms</code> value.</p>
<p>There are two settings that prompt you to update:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
If the security realm settings are located in <code class="literal">user_settings_override</code>, contact support to help you upgrade.

<li class="listitem">
If the security realm settings are located in <code class="literal">user_settings</code>, you&#8217;ll receive a message that allows you modify these settings.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To modify the <code class="literal">user_settings</code>:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
