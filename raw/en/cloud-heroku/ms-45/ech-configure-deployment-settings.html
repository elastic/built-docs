<p>The following deployment settings are available:</p>
<h4><a id="echcloud_provider"></a>Cloud provider</h4>
<p>Selects a cloud platform where your Elasticsearch clusters and Kibana instances will be hosted. Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku currently supports Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.</p>
<h4><a id="echregion"></a>Region</h4>
<p>Regions represent data centers in a geographic location, where your deployment will be located. When choosing a region, the general rule is to choose one as close to your application servers as possible in order to minimize network delays.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>You can select your cloud platform and region only when you create a new deployment, so pick ones that works for you. They cannot be changed later. Different deployments can use different platforms and regions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4><a id="echversion"></a>Version</h4>
<p>Elasticsearch versions are denoted as <code class="literal">X.Y.Z</code>, where <code class="literal">X</code> is the major version, <code class="literal">Y</code> is the minor version, and <code class="literal">Z</code> is the patch level or maintenance release. The default version is the latest, stable version. At any given time, the two latest minor versions are guaranteed to be available for deployments of new clusters, such as Elasticsearch 5.5.1 and 5.4.3. Only the latest patch level within a minor version is usually available for new deployments, such as 2.4.<span class="strong strong"><strong>5</strong></span>.</p>
<p>All versions listed in the user interface can be deployed, including release candidate builds.</p>
<p>To deliver new features and keep complexity manageable, we need to discontinue old versions. When a version nears its end-of-life point, you are given six months notice to upgrade to one of the available minor versions.</p>
<p>To learn more about how we support Elasticsearch versions in Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku, see <a class="xref" href="ech-version-policy.html" title="Version policy">Version Policy</a>.</p>
<p>You can always upgrade Elasticsearch versions, but you cannot downgrade. To learn more about upgrading versions of Elasticsearch and best practices for major version upgrades, see <a class="xref" href="ech-upgrade-deployment.html" title="Upgrade versions">Version Upgrades</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="echsnapshot_source"></a>Snapshot source</h4>
<p>To create a deployment from a snapshot, select the snapshot source. You need to <a class="xref" href="ech-snapshot-restore.html" title="Snapshot and restore">configure snapshots</a> and establish a snapshot lifecycle management policy and repository before you can restore from a snapshot. The snapshot options depend on the stack version the deployment is running.</p>
<h4><a id="echname"></a>Name</h4>
<p>This setting allows you to assign a more human-friendly name to your cluster which will be used for future reference in the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku console</a>. Common choices are dev, prod, test, or something more domain specific.</p>
