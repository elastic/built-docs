<p>Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku now supports additional features that let you do more with our hosted offering:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Review your pricing updates.</strong></span> To give you more control over your usage and spending, we&#8217;re providing a more granular billing breakdown for snapshot storage and data transfer costs. These billing changes were released last August and the charges were fully discounted during the promotional period, which ends on February 28, 2019. <a href="/blog/elasticsearch-service-data-transfer-and-snapshot-storage-pricing" class="ulink" target="_top">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Bigger trial capacity and increased defaults.</strong></span> Our Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku trial now starts with 8 GB of memory for the Elasticsearch cluster, as well as increasing the default settings for templates. All the more room to play with.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Increased scaling limit for nodes.</strong></span> For better scaling, we&#8217;ve increased the maximum number of nodes possible. Previously at five nodes, the limit has been increased to 10 nodes, per instance configuration. This allows for instance sizes of 10 nodes per availability zone, and in the case of hot/warm architecture, 20 nodes per availability zone.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Is it us?</strong></span> We&#8217;re asking for feedback if you delete all of your deployments. No problem if you&#8217;re just spinning something up later, but if there is something we can improve, let us know!
