<p>When using Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku, there are some limitations you should be aware of:</p>

<p>Occasionally, we also publish information about <a class="xref" href="ech-restrictions.html#ech-known-problems" title="Known problems">Known problems</a> with our Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku or the Elastic Stack.</p>
<p>To learn more about the features that are supported by Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku, see <a href="/cloud/elasticsearch-service/subscriptions" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Cloud Subscriptions</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="ech-restrictions-heroku"></a>Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku</h3>
<p>Not all features of our Elasticsearch Service are available to Heroku users. Specifically, you cannot create additional deployments or use different deployment templates.</p>
<p>Generally, if a feature is shown as available in the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku console</a>, you can use it.</p>
<h3><a id="ech-restrictions-elastic-stack"></a>Elastic Stack</h3>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Cross-cluster replication is not supported.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Dedicated ingest nodes are not supported.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a id="ech-restrictions-monitoring"></a>Monitoring</h3>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
To avoid compatibility issues between versions, the cluster sending monitoring metrics and the monitoring cluster receiving them should be at the same Elasticsearch version. If using the same version is not feasible, check for breaking changes in the <a href="/guide/en/x-pack/6.2/xpack-release-notes.html" class="ulink" target="_top">X-Pack Release Notes</a> or the <a href="/guide/en/marvel/2.4/release-notes.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Marvel Release Notes</a> to make sure that your versions are compatible.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<a id="cross-region-monitor"></a> Monitoring across regions is not supported. If you need to move your existing monitoring to the same region, you can do a reindex or create a new cluster and select the snapshot from the old cluster.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Monitoring data that gets sent to a dedicated monitoring Elasticsearch cluster <a class="xref" href="ech-enable-monitoring.html#ech-monitoring-retention" title="Retention of monitoring daily indices">is not cleaned up automatically</a> and might require some additional steps to remove excess data periodically.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a id="ech-restrictions-security"></a>Security</h3>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
IP filtering with the X-Pack or Shield security features is currently not available.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
LDAP is not supported.

<li class="listitem">
Audit logging is disabled.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Client certificates, such as PKI certificates, are not supported.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a id="ech-restrictions-transport-client"></a>Transport client</h3>
<p>The transport client is not considered thread safe in a cloud environment. We recommend that you use the Java REST client instead. This restriction relates to the fact that your deployments hosted on Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku are behind proxies, which prevent the transport client from communicating directly with Elasticsearch clusters.</p>
<h3><a id="ech-restrictions-plugins"></a>Elasticsearch and Kibana plugins</h3>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Kibana plugins are not supported.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Some Elasticsearch plugins do not apply to Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku. For example, you won&#8217;t ever need to change discovery, as Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku handles how nodes discover one another.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
In Elasticsearch 5.0 and later, site plugins are no longer supported. This change does not affect the site plugins Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku might provide out of the box, such as Kopf or Head, since these site plugins are serviced by our proxies and not Elasticsearch itself.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
In Elasticsearch 5.0 and later, site plugins such as Kopf and Paramedic are no longer provided. We recommend that you use our <a class="xref" href="ech-monitoring.html" title="Keeping your cluster healthy">cluster performance metrics</a>, <a class="xref" href="ech-monitoring.html" title="Keeping your cluster healthy">X-Pack monitoring features</a> and Kibana&#8217;s (6.3+) <a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.6/managing-indices.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Index Management UI</a> if you want more detailed information or perform index management actions.

<p>Changing the default throttle period is not possible. You can specify a throttle period per watch, however.</p>

<h3><a id="ech-restrictions-apm"></a>APM with AWS Marketplace subscriptions</h3>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You cannot spin up an APM Server as part of a deployment hosted on Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku. If you want to use APM, you can still host it on your own host and connect it to your Cloud deployment. To learn more, see <a href="/guide/en/apm/server/7.6/configure-cloud-id.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Configure the output for the Elastic Cloud</a>.

<h3><a id="ech-restrictions-ccs"></a>Cross-cluster search unavailable for AWS Marketplace subscriptions</h3>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You cannot spin up a cross-cluster search deployment hosted on Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku. Cross-cluster search functionality is not supported.

<h3><a id="ech-known-problems"></a>Known problems</h3>
<p>There is a <a class="xref" href="ech-release-notes-2018-06-25.html" title="Known issue affecting 5.6.10 to 6.3.0 upgrades">known issue affecting 5.6.10 to 6.3.0 upgrades</a>. A fix is available in a later version of the Elastic Stack or you can open a support ticket to receive help.</p>
<p>It is not possible to upgrade an App Search deployment to a version above 7.6 without migrating to Enterprise Search. Currently, in case Elasticsearch is upgraded to a version higher than 7.6, you will be met with an Upgrade notification for App Search to match the Elasticsearch version, which cannot be fulfilled as there is no matching App Search version.
Beginning with Elastic Stack version 7.7, App Search and Workplace Search are bundled together. In the future, both products will be available as a single Elastic Enterprise Search deployment on the Elasticsearch Service. In order to provide an easier transition to Enterprise Search, we will also add an assistant to help users move from their 7.6 App Search deployments to Elastic Enterprise Search deployments.</p>
<p>There is a known problem affecting clusters with versions 7.7.0 and 7.7.1 due to <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56739" class="ulink" target="_top">a bug in Elasticsearch</a>.
Although rare, this bug can prevent you from running plans. If this occurs we recommend that you retry the plan, and if that fails please contact support to get your plan through.
Because of this bug we recommend you to upgrade to version 7.8 and higher, where the problem has already been addressed.</p>
