<p>Elastic Cloud now supports additional features that let you do more with our hosted offering:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Support for larger custom plugins.</strong></span> For Elastic Cloud Gold and Platinum subscriptions, we now support custom plugins up to 1 GB in size.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Easier versioning for custom bundles</strong></span>. Custom bundles now support wildcard versioning with <code class="literal">*</code> in addition to the previously supported versioning options, such as <code class="literal">7.*</code> and <code class="literal">7.3.0</code>. Omitting a version with <code class="literal">""</code> is also supported. The main benefit of specifying <code class="literal">*</code> as the version wildcard is to simplify major version upgrades: you can now upgrade a deployment to any new version of the Elastic Stack without also having to upgrade the custom bundle.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Improved pricing calculator</strong></span>. We&#8217;ve made it easier for you to get the cost and instance sizes for each Elastic Stack component. The pricing calculator now breaks down the cost and instance sizes for Elasticsearch, Kibana, machine learning, and APM separately. We also made it easier for you to contact us if you are are interested in a Gold or Platinum subscription. <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/pricing" class="ulink" target="_top">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Support for smaller trial sizes</strong></span>. Enjoying your Elastic Cloud trial? You can now scale your deployment down to a smaller size than what the trial initially offers you. Use this functionality to check if a smaller deployment is sufficient for your workload or before  providing billing information.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Improved capacity validation</strong></span>. We improved the resilience of deployment configuration changes (sometimes referred to as <em>plan changes</em>) when insufficient capacity to address your request might exist temporarily. Elastic Cloud now automatically retries the configuration change before returning an error message.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Support for voting-only Elasticsearch nodes</strong></span>. Elastic Cloud has supported cloud-specific tiebreaker nodes to ensure a quorum for Elasticsearch nodes for some time. For Elasticsearch 7.3.0 and later, we now support the use of Elasticsearch voting-only nodes to ensure that a quorum exists if the cluster suffers from a network partition that divides it into two equally-sized halves, also known as a <em>split-brain</em> scenario. <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.19/modules-discovery-voting.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Maintenance mode for APM and Kibana</strong></span>. New UI buttons now let you start and stop maintenance mode for APM and Kibana, which stops new requests from being routed to these instances. If you are performing administrative tasks on APM or Kibana, you can use these buttons to block or re-enable access for your users.
</li>

<p>We fixed the following bugs:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
If you subscribe to Elastic Cloud through AWS Marketplace billing, you can now change your email address as expected.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
For customers with expired trials who converted to a subscription, we fixed a billing issue that could affect you if you tried to restore your trial deployment later on.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To make it easier for you to troubleshoot operational issues with Elastic Cloud, we added links to help you create a support case rather than ask you to send an email to Support.
