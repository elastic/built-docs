<p>ECK reached general availability (GA) status with the <a href="/blog/elastic-cloud-on-kubernetes-ECK-is-now-generally-available" class="ulink" target="_top">release of version 1.0.0</a>. The latest available GA version is 1.2.2. It is compatible with the previous GA releases (1.0.x and 1.1.x) and the beta release (1.0.0-beta1), and can be upgraded in-place (<a class="xref" href="k8s-upgrading-eck.html#k8s-ga-openshift" title="Upgrade from beta to GA on older versions of Kubernetes">with a few exceptions</a>) by applying the new set of deployment manifests. Previous alpha releases, up to and including version 0.9.0, are not compatible with the GA and beta releases and <a href="/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/1.0-beta/k8s-upgrading-eck.html" class="ulink" target="_top">require extra work to upgrade</a>.</p>
<p>Before upgrading, refer to the <a class="xref" href="release-notes-1.2.2.html" title="Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes version 1.2.2">release notes</a> to make sure that the release does not contain any breaking changes that could affect you. The <a class="xref" href="release-highlights-1.2.2.html" title="1.2.2 release highlights">release highlights document</a> provides more details and possible workarounds for any breaking changes or known issues in each release.</p>
<p>Note that the release notes and highlights only list the changes since the last release. If you are skipping over any intermediate versions during the upgrade&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;such as going directly from 1.0.0-beta1 to 1.2.2&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;review the release notes and highlights of each of the skipped releases to fully understand all the breaking changes you might encounter during and after the upgrade.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions in <a class="xref" href="k8s-deploy-eck.html" title="Deploy ECK in your Kubernetes cluster"><em>Deploy ECK in your Kubernetes cluster</em></a> to upgrade ECK to the latest version.

<p>Upgrading the operator results in a one-time update to existing managed resources in the cluster. This triggers a rolling restart of pods by Kubernetes to apply those changes. If you have a very large Elasticsearch cluster or multiple Elastic Stack deployments, this rolling restart might be disruptive or inconvenient. To have more control over when the pods belonging to a particular deployment should be restarted, you can <a class="xref" href="k8s-troubleshooting-methods.html#k8s-exclude-resource" title="Exclude resources from reconciliation">add an annotation</a> to the corresponding Elasticsearch, Kibana, or APM Server resources to temporarily exclude them from being managed by the operator. When the time is convenient, you can remove the annotation and let the rolling restart go through.</p>

<p>Once a resource is excluded from being managed by ECK, you will not be able to add/remove nodes, upgrade Stack version, or perform other <a class="xref" href="k8s-orchestrating-elastic-stack-applications.html" title="Orchestrating Elastic Stack applications">orchestration tasks</a> by updating the resource manifest. You must remember to remove the exclusion to ensure that your Elastic Stack deployment is continually monitored and managed by the operator.</p>
