<p>Subscribe to Elasticsearch Service directly from the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You then have the convenience of viewing your Elasticsearch Service subscription as part of your GCP bill, and you do not have to supply any additional credit card information to Elastic.</p>
<p>Some differences exist when you subscribe to Elasticsearch Service through the GCP Marketplace:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
There is no trial period. Billing starts when you subscribe to Elasticsearch Service.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Existing Elasticsearch Service organizations cannot be converted to use the GCP Marketplace.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Pricing for an Elasticsearch Service subscription through the GCP Marketplace differs from our direct billing model and follows the pricing outlined on the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/endpoints/elasticsearch-service.gcpmarketplace.elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud</a> page in the GCP Marketplace. Pricing is based on a few different parameters such as the GCP region (Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific), the RAM size of your cluster in GB, and the level of high availability, billed per hour. Other parameters include data transfer out, data transfer internode, snapshot storage and snapshot APIs. For more details, check <a class="xref" href="ec-billing-dimensions.html" title="Billing Dimensions">Billing Dimensions</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To access your billing information at any time go to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Account &amp; Billing</strong></span>. You can also go to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Account &amp; Billing</strong></span> and then <span class="strong strong"><strong>Usage</strong></span> to view your usage hours and units per hour.

<p>To subscribe to Elasticsearch Service through the GCP Marketplace:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Go to the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/elastic-prod/elastic-cloud" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Cloud (Elasticsearch Service)</a> page in the GCP Marketplace.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
On the Elastic Cloud page select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Subscribe</strong></span>, where you will be directed to another page. There is only one plan—the Elastic plan—and it&#8217;s pre-selected. The billing account you are logged into will be pre-selected for this purchase, though you can change it at this time.

<p>Accept the terms of service (TOS) and select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Subscribe</strong></span>.</p>

<li class="listitem">
After choosing to sign up, a new window will appear and you will need to create a new, unique user account. You cannot reuse an existing email address for this step. This sign up will link the billing account used for the purchase on GCP Marketplace to a new Elastic organization.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>After signing up, check your inbox to verify the email address you signed up with. Upon verification, you will be asked to create a password, and once created your organization will be set up and you will be logged into it.</p>

<div class="admon_content">
<p>Immediately after your first login to Elastic Cloud you may briefly see a banner on the Elastic Cloud user console saying that your account is disconnected. There is sometimes a short delay in activation, but refreshing the page is generally enough time to allow its completion. If this issue persists, please contact support.</p>

<p>If you have existing deployments that you want to migrate to your new marketplace account, we recommend using a custom repository to take a snapshot. Then restore that snapshot to a new deployment in your new marketplace account.

<p>Elasticsearch Service subscriptions through GCP Marketplace are associated with a GCP billing account.  In order to change the billing account associated with an Elasticsearch Service organization:
- for customers under a Private Offer contract: please reach out to Elastic support and provide the GCP Billing Account, as well as the contact of any reseller information for approval.
- for pay-as-you-go customers: you need to have purchased and subscribed to Elastic Cloud on the new billing account using the details above—but do not create a new Elastic user or organization (that is, you can skip Steps 5 and 6 in the subscription instructions, above). Once you successfully subscribed with the new billing account, you can contact Elastic support and provide the new billing account ID you wish to move to, which you can find from <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/billing" class="ulink" target="_top">GCP&#8217;s billing page</a>. The ID is in the format <code class="literal">000000-000000-000000</code>.</p>
<p>If you cancel your Elasticsearch Service order on GCP through the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/orders" class="ulink" target="_top">marketplace orders page</a> before the switch to the new billing account has been done, any running deployments will immediately enter a degraded state known as maintenance mode and they will be scheduled for termination in five days.</p>
<p>If you already unsubscribed before the new billing account has been set up, you can subscribe again from the previously used billing account, which will cancel the termination and restore the deployments to a functional state.</p>
