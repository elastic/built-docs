<p>You can subscribe to Elasticsearch Service directly from the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You then have the convenience of viewing your Elasticsearch Service subscription as part of your GCP bill, and you do not have to supply any additional credit card information to Elastic.</p>
<p>Some differences exist when you subscribe to Elasticsearch Service through the GCP Marketplace:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
There is no trial period. Billing starts when you subscribe to Elasticsearch Service.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Previous Elasticsearch Service accounts cannot be converted to use the GCP Marketplace. If you already have an account, you must use a different email address when you sign up for a subscription through the GCP Marketplace.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Pricing for an Elasticsearch Service subscription through the GCP Marketplace differs from our direct billing model and follows the pricing outlined on the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/endpoints/elasticsearch-service.gcpmarketplace.elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud</a> page in the GCP Marketplace. Pricing is based on the GCP region (Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific), the RAM size of your cluster in GB, and the level of high availability, billed per hour, as well as some other parameters such as data transfer out, data transfer internode, snapshot storage and snapshot APIs. For more details, check <a class="xref" href="ec-billing-dimensions.html" title="Billing Dimensions">Billing Dimensions</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To access your billing information at any time, from the user menu, go to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Account &amp; Billing</strong></span>. Follow the link on that page to view your billing details from within the GCP Marketplace. You can also go to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Account &amp; Billing</strong></span> and then <span class="strong strong"><strong>Usage</strong></span> to view your usage hours and units per hour.

</ul>

<p>When you subscribe to Elasticsearch Service through GCP Marketplace billing you cannot use an email that already has an Elastic Cloud account.  If you also want to use the same account email with GCP Marketplace billing, you must first change the primary email on your existing account before setting up your new GCP Marketplace account as shown in these steps.</p>

<p>If you have existing deployments that you want to migrate to your new marketplace account, we recommend using a custom repository to take a snapshot, and then restoring that snapshot to a new deployment in your new marketplace account.

<h4><a id="ec-billing-gcp-account-change"></a>Changes to your Billing Account<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-84/docs/saas/ec-marketplace-gcp.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>While Elasticsearch Service subscriptions through GCP Marketplace are associated with a GCP project, that project must be associated with a GCP billing account. Due to a current limitation of the GCP Marketplace, changes to the billing account associated with your project may cause disruption to your Elasticsearch Service deployments.</p>
<p>Deployments in this scenario may be put into maintenance mode and operate in a degraded state until you have re-enabled your subscription within the GCP Marketplace. With no further action, deployments will be terminated after 5 days.</p>
<p>To re-enable your subscription:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Go to the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/endpoints/elasticsearch-service.gcpmarketplace.elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud</a> page in the GCP Marketplace.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account, if you aren&#8217;t already.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
On the Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud page, select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enable</strong></span>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enable</strong></span> within 5 days from the time of disruption, your deployments will begin operating again momentarily and usage fees will take effect from the time that the service is enabled.
