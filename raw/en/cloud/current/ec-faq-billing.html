If you have any further questions about your credit card statement, billing, or receipts, please send an email to <a href="mailto:ar@elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">ar@elastic.co</a> or open a <a class="xref" href="ec-get-help.html" title="Getting help">Support case</a> using the <em>Billing issue</em> category.

<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-charge"></a>Why is my credit card charged?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
If you are on a monthly plan, the charge is a recurring fee for using our hosted Elasticsearch Service. The fee is normally charged at the start of each month, but it can also be charged at other times during the month. If a charge is unsuccessful, we will try to charge your card again at a later date.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-when"></a>When is my credit card charged?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
You are billed on the first day of each month for usage in the prior month.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-whystillcharged"></a>Why is my credit card charged if I canceled my trial?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
If you add a credit card to your Elastic Cloud account at any time during the trial period, the trial is converted to a paid subscription. You then have to pay for any expense incurred by your deployment beginning when the credit card was added. If you delete your deployment at a later date, you will still be invoiced for any usage that occurs between the conversion date and the deployment deletion date.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-cancelpolicy"></a>What is the cancellation policy for monthly subscriptions?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
There are no cancellation or termination fees for monthly subscriptions. If the service is no longer needed, you can spin down all of your deployments. Usage for that month will be billed at the end of the month in your final bill.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-chargednotusing"></a>Why am I being charged if I don’t use any of my deployments?

Even if you have no activity on your account and you haven&#8217;t logged into the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Console</a>, your active deployments still incur costs that we need to charge you for. To avoid being charged for active but unused deployments, you can simply delete them. Your account will stay active with no charges, and you can always spin up more capacity when you need it.

<a id="faq-deleteaccount"></a>How can I delete my Elastic Cloud account?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
To have your account removed, you can contact support through the Elasticsearch Service <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/support?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Support form</a> or use one of these <a class="xref" href="ec-get-help.html" title="Getting help">alternative contact methods</a>.

<span class="term">
<a id="faq-refund"></a>Can I get a refund?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Charges are non-refundable, but once you delete a deployment we&#8217;ll stop charging you for that deployment immediately. You only pay for what you use and you can stop using the service at any time. For any special considerations warranting a potential refund, please use the Elasticsearch Service Console <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/support?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Support form</a> to open a support case and select <em>Billing issue</em> as the category. To ensure quick processing, be sure to provide detail about the reasons for the refund request as well as other matters pertaining to the issue.

<a id="faq-annualprepaid"></a>How does an annual prepaid contract work?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
If you have signed up for an annual contract, you are purchasing a number of credits expressed as a dollar amount. These credits are then prorated hourly and distributed across every monthly billing cycle. If you consume less than the allocated credits within a given month, the credits are lost and not carried over to the next month. If you spend more than you have prepaid in a given month, you will be charged overages (additional costs) at list price for the additional consumption.
</p>
<p>In any billing cycle, either of the following occurrences can trigger additional costs (overages):</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">

<p>You have made changes to your deployments that generated additional costs. These changes can be:</p>

Example
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Assume that you have purchased $1200 worth of usage for the entire year, excluding any discount. This means that every month you get approximately $100 worth of usage as prepaid credits. Note that the annual credit amount is prorated hourly, so there are slight differences in the allocated credits between 30 and 31-day months.
</p>
<p>At the end of each month, your usage is summed up and the prepaid credits are deducted. Let’s say that in the third contract month you used a total of $175 in capacity and data transfer and snapshot storage. We then deduct $100 of prepaid credits from the $175 of usage, and we invoice you for the remaining $75.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-prepaidcover"></a>What do the prepaid credits cover?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
In you have an annual contract, your prepaid credits are used to cover all usage, including capacity, data transfer and snapshot storage. The credits are calculated and applied on a monthly basis. This means that the annual prepaid amount is prorated for the duration in hours of a given month and then applied to that month’s usage.
</p>
<p>If you have a lower usage than the prepaid credits (for example, you have scaled down your deployment), any remaining credits are lost and will not be carried over to the next month.</p>
<p>If your usage is higher than the available prepaid credits for the current month, you will be charged overages for the month.</p>
<p>You can use a different region than the one you prepaid for. If the new region is more expensive, the difference in price will be charged as an overage.</p>
