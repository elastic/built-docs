<a id="faq-what"></a>What is Elasticsearch Service?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Elasticsearch Service is hosted and managed Elasticsearch and Kibana brought to you by the creators of Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch Service is part of Elastic Cloud and ships with features that you can only get from the company behind Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash. Elasticsearch is a full text search engine that suits a range of uses, from search on websites to big data analytics and more.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-aws-difference"></a>Is Elasticsearch Service the same as Amazon&#8217;s Elasticsearch Service?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Elasticsearch Service is not the same as the Amazon Elasticsearch service. To learn more about the differences, see our <a href="/aws-elasticsearch-service" class="ulink" target="_top">AWS Elasticsearch Service</a> comparison.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-full-stack"></a>Can I run the full Elastic Stack in Elasticsearch Service?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Many of the products that are part of the Elastic Stack are readily available in Elasticsearch Service, including Elasticsearch, Kibana, X-Pack features such as monitoring and security, and others, including plugins. Other Elastic Stack products you can use directly with Elasticsearch Service, even if they don&#8217;t currently run there. For example, both Logstash and Beats can send their data to Elasticsearch Service, just as you would send data to any other Elasticsearch cluster. What you can run is also determined by your <a href="/cloud/as-a-service/subscriptions" class="ulink" target="_top">subscription level</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-trial"></a>Can I try Elasticsearch Service for free?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Yes, you can sign up for a 14-day free trial. The trial starts the moment you create a cluster.
</p>
<p>During the free trial period, you get access to a deployment to explore Elastic solutions for Enterprise Search, Observability, Security, or the latest version of the Elastic Stack.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-config"></a>What if I need to change the size of my Elasticsearch cluster at a later time?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
You can scale your clusters both up and down from the user console, whenever you like. The resizing of the cluster is transparently done in the background, and highly available clusters are resized without any downtime. If you scale your cluster down, make sure that the downsized cluster can handle your Elasticsearch memory requirements. Read more about sizing and memory in our articles <a href="/blog/found-sizing-elasticsearch" class="ulink" target="_top">Sizing Elasticsearch</a> and <a href="/blog/found-elasticsearch-in-production/#memory" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch in Production</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-subscriptions"></a>Do you offer support?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Yes, all subscription levels for Elasticsearch Service include support, handled by email or through the Elastic Support Portal. Different subscription levels include different levels of support. For the Standard subscription level, there is no service-level agreement (SLA) on support response times. Gold and Platinum subscription levels include an SLA on response times to tickets and dedicated resources.

<span class="term">
<a id="faq-where"></a>Where is Elasticsearch Service hosted?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
We host our Elasticsearch clusters on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure. Check out which <a href="/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-reference-regions.html" class="ulink" target="_top">regions we support</a> and what <a href="/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-reference-hardware.html" class="ulink" target="_top">hardware we use</a>. New data centers get added all the time.

<span class="term">
<a id="faq-vs-aws"></a>What is the difference between Elasticsearch Service and the Amazon Elasticsearch Service?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Elasticsearch Service is the only hosted and managed Elasticsearch service built, managed, and supported by the company behind Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash. With Elasticsearch Service, you always get the latest versions of the software. Our service is built on best practices and years of experience hosting and managing thousands of Elasticsearch clusters in the Cloud and on premise. For more information, see the following Amazon and Elastic Elasticsearch Service <a href="/aws-elasticsearch-service" class="ulink" target="_top">comparison page</a>.
</p>
<p>Please note that there is no formal partnership between Elastic and Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Elastic does not provide any support on the AWS Elasticsearch Service.</p>

<span class="term">
<a id="faq-elastic"></a>Do you offer Elastic&#8217;s commercial products?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Yes, all Elasticsearch Service customers get access to basic authentication and role-based access control, in addition to monitoring capability.
</p>
<p>Elasticsearch Service Gold, Platinum and Enterprise customers get complete access to all the capabilities in X-Pack:</p>

<a id="faq-x-pack"></a>Is my Elasticsearch cluster protected by X-Pack?

Yes, X-Pack security features give you the full power to protect your Elasticsearch Service deployment with basic authentication and role-based access control.

<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-limit"></a>Is there a limit on the number of documents or indexes I can have in my cluster?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
No. We do not enforce any artificial limit on the number of indexes or documents you can store in your cluster.
</p>
<p>That said, there is a limit to how many indexes Elasticsearch can cope with. Every shard of every index is a separate Lucene index, which in turn comprises several files. A process cannot have an unlimited number of open files. Also, every shard has its associated control structures in memory. So, while we will let you make as many indexes as you want, there are limiting factors. Our larger plans provide your processes with more dedicated memory and CPU-shares, so they are capable of handling more indexes. The number of indexes or documents you can fit in a given plan therefore depends on their structure and use.</p>
