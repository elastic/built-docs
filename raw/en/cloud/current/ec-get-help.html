<p>With your Elasticsearch Service subscription, you get access to support from the creators of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, Logstash, and much more. We&#8217;re here to help!</p>
<h3><a id="ec_how_do_i_open_a_support_case"></a>How do I open a support case?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-111/docs/saas/ec-support.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>All roads lead to the Elastic Support Portal, where you can access to all your cases, subscriptions, and licenses.</p>
<p>As an Elasticsearch Service customer, you will receive an email with instructions how to log in to the Support Portal, where you can track both current and archived cases. If you are a new customer who just signed up for Elasticsearch Service, it can take a few hours for your Support Portal access to be set up. If you have questions, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:support@elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">support@elastic.co</a>.</p>

<p>With the release of the new Support Portal, even if you have an existing account, you might be prompted to update your password.</p>

</div>
<p>There are three ways you can get to the portal:</p>

<p>Support is governed by the <a href="/legal/terms-of-service/cloud" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Standard Terms of Service</a>. The level of support you can expect to receive applies to your Elasticsearch Service environment only and depends on your subscription level:</p>

Support is provided by email or through the Elastic Support Portal. The main focus of support is to ensure your Elasticsearch Service deployment shows a green status and is available. There is no guaranteed initial or ongoing response time, but we do strive to engage on every issue within three business days. We do not offer weekend coverage, so we respond Monday through Friday only.
