<p>By inviting users to join your organization, you can allow them to interact with all or specific instances and settings. To do that, some predefined roles are available for you to assign to your organization&#8217;s members.</p>
<p>To invite a new member, go to your avatar in the upper right corner, choose <span class="strong strong"><strong>Organization</strong></span> and click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Invite members</strong></span>. You can add multiple members by entering their email addresses separated by a space. You can also assign roles to the users when you invite them, so that they automatically get the appropriate permissions when they accept the invitation and sign in to Elastic Cloud.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Users can only belong to one organization at a time. If a user that you want to invite already belongs to a different organization, that user first needs to leave their current organization, or to use a different email address.

<p>On the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Members</strong></span> tab of the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Organization</strong></span> page, you can view the list of current members, their status, and their roles.</p>
