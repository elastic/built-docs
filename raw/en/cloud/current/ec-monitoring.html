<p>Keeping on top of the health of your deployments is a key part of the <a href="/cloud/shared-responsibility" class="ulink" target="_top">shared responsibilities</a> between Elastic and yourself.

<h2><a id="ec-health-warnings"></a>Health warnings<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-72/docs/shared/ec-ce-monitoring.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>In the normal course of using your Elasticsearch Service deployments, health warnings and errors are expected to appear from time to time. Following are the most common scenarios and methods to resolve them.</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Health warning messages
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Health warning messages will sometimes appear on the main page for one of your deployments, as well as on the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Logs and metrics</strong></span> page.
</p>
<p>A single warning is rarely cause for concern, as often it just reflects ongoing, routine maintenance activity occuring on the Elasticsearch Service platform. In many cases the warning will disappear over time. If you&#8217;d rather not wait, you can run a no-op plan as decribed in <a class="xref" href="ec-deployment-no-op.html" title="Scenario: How do I resolve deployment health warnings?">How do I resolve deployment health warnings?</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Configuration change failures
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
In more serious cases, your deployment may be unable to restart. The failure can be due to a variety of causes, the most frequent of these being invalid secure settings, expired plugins or bundles, or out of memory errors. The problem is often not detected until an attempt is made to restart the deployment following a routine configuration change, such as a deployment resizing.
</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve collected together the most common of these causes so that you can <a class="xref" href="ec-config-change-errors.html" title="Scenario: How do I resolve configuration change failures?">resolve configuration change failures</a> as quickly and painlessly as possible. And, just in case these solutions don&#8217;t help, you can always <a class="xref" href="ec-get-help.html" title="Getting help">ask for help</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Out of memory errors
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Out memory errors (OOMs) may occur during your deployment&#8217;s normal operations, and these can have a very negative impact on performance. Common causes of memory shortages are oversharding, data retention oversights, and the overall request volume.
</p>
<p>On your deployment page, you can check the <a class="xref" href="ec-memory-pressure.html" title="JVM memory pressure indicator">JVM memory pressure indicator</a> to get the current memory usage of each node of your deployment. You can also review the <a class="xref" href="ec-memory-pressure.html#ec-memory-pressure-causes" title="Common causes of high JVM memory usage">common causes of high JVM memory usage</a> to help diagnose the source of unexpectedly high memory pressure levels.

<h2><a id="ec-health-monitoring"></a>Health monitoring<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-72/docs/shared/ec-ce-monitoring.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>In a production environment, it&#8217;s important set up dedicated health monitoring in order to retain the logs and metrics that can be used to troubleshoot any health issues in your deployments. In the event of that you need to <a class="xref" href="ec-get-help.html" title="Getting help">contact our support team</a>, they can use the retained data to help diagnose any problems that you may encounter.</p>
<p>You have the option of sending logs and metrics to a separate, specialized monitoring deployment, which ensures that they&#8217;re available in the event of a deployment outage. The monitoring deployment also gives you access to Kibana&#8217;s stack monitoring features, through which you can view health and performance data for all of your deployment resources.</p>
<p>As part of health monitoring, it&#8217;s also a best practice to <a class="xref" href="ec-cluster-health-notifications.html" title="Get notified about deployment health issues">configure alerting</a>, so that you can be notified right away about any deployment health issues.</p>
<p>Read through our <a class="xref" href="ec-monitoring-setup.html" title="How to set up monitoring">How to set up monitoring</a> guide to learn more.</p>

<p>In a non-production environment, you may choose to rely on the logs and metrics that are available for your deployment by default. The deployment <span class="strong strong"><strong>Logs and metrics</strong></span> page displays any current deployment health warnings, and from there you can also view standard log files from the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>The logs capture any activity related to your deployments, their component resources, snapshotting behavior, and more. You can use the search bar to filter the logs by, for example, a specific instance (<code class="literal">instance-0000000005</code>), a configuration file (<code class="literal">roles.yml</code>), an operation type (<code class="literal">snapshot</code>, <code class="literal">autoscaling</code>), or a component (<code class="literal">kibana</code>, <code class="literal">ent-search</code>).</p>

<p>The deployment <a class="xref" href="ec-activity-page.html" title="Keep track of deployment activity">Activity page</a> gives you quick access to a record of all configuration changes that have been applied to your deployment, including the timing, the initiating user, and whether or not the change was successful.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve compiled some guidelines to help you ensure the health of your deployments over time. These can help you to better understand the available performance metrics, and to make decisions involving performance and high availability.</p>
