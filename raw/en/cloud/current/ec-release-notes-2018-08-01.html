<p>The next generation of Elasticsearch Service is here. This is the most significant redesign of our hosted service since its original inception and it has one goal in mind: To let you solve more use cases with Elasticsearch Service than ever before.</p>
<p>With our new features, you can:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Deploy the Elastic Stack using our new deployment templates. These flexible, customizable templates are designed to fit your use case better, whether it&#8217;s search, logging or whatever challenge you can think up for Elasticsearch Service. Regardless of which template you choose, it&#8217;s backed by hardware that is optimized for I/O, CPU, memory, and storage to match the use case.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Add machine learning to your deployments to gain insight and predict anomalies. Previously available for the Elastic Stack on-prem, now supported on Elasticsearch Service.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Machine learning requires Elasticsearch version 6.3.1 or later, but you can upgrade your deployment to a supported version first and then add machine learning.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Deploy a hot-warm architecture with index lifecycle management. Quickly ingest and query current data, while keeping older data around on more cost-effective storage. If you need a complete logging solution, this is it.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Deploy Kibana across multiple availability zones with your Elasticsearch cluster and scale Kibana to whatever size you need.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Improve the resilience of your deployments by adding dedicated master nodes. Larger-scale deployments get them automatically.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>With this redesign, we have also introduced a new, more transparent pricing model and free tier to make getting started even easier.</p>
<p>As before, you can manage hosted Elasticsearch and Kibana from our <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&amp;placement=docs-body" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Console</a>. Our UI might look different with its new sliders, but your existing deployments will continue to work exactly as before.
To start using the new features, <a class="xref" href="ec-create-deployment.html" title="Create a hosted deployment">create a new deployment</a> or <a class="xref" href="ec-customize-deployment.html" title="Change your configuration">reconfigure an existing one</a>. It&#8217;s as simple as that.</p>
