<p>Elasticsearch Service now supports additional features that let you do more with our hosted offering:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Support for the Elasticsearch keystore.</strong></span> To safely store your sensitive settings, you can now add keys, key and value pairs, and JSON blocks to the Elasticsearch keystore. <a class="xref" href="ec-configuring-keystore.html" title="Secure your settings">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Upgrade to the Elastic Stack 7.0 pack.</strong></span> We&#8217;re not quite ready to release Elastic Stack 7.0 yet, but this release of Elasticsearch Service includes the support for Elastic&#8217;s latest and greatest stack version. Stay tuned!
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Faster deployment creation.</strong></span> We’ve sped up creating deployments with a constructor update that temporarily disables the CPU limit for instances during startup. As soon as the instances in your deployment have started, the CPU limit is reactivated to avoid noisy neighbor issues. With this update, deployments can now be created in as little as 30 seconds.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>On-demand snapshots.</strong></span> You can now create a snapshot of your data in a single step, without having to wait for the next scheduled snapshot to occur. Want a backup of your data before performing an action on your deployment or need a backup sooner than the next scheduled snapshot? Just use the button. <a class="xref" href="ec-restoring-snapshots.html" title="Work with snapshots">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>

<span class="strong strong"><strong>Detailed billing details for upcoming data transfer and snapshot storage charges.</strong></span> Billing details on customer invoices now break out the amounts for data transfer in/out, data transfer between nodes, and snapshot storage. Previously, these amounts were zeroed out or not shown in full detail. As a reminder, this change is part of a larger overhaul of how we bill customers for Elasticsearch Service. <a href="/blog/elasticsearch-service-data-transfer-and-snapshot-storage-pricing" class="ulink" target="_top">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>

<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Elasticsearch 2.x end of life.</strong></span> It&#8217;s time to say goodbye: Elasticsearch 2.x has reached its end of life (EOL) last year and Elasticsearch Service can no longer support this version. If you have a cluster that is using Elasticsearch 2.x, upgrade to 5.x or later. <a class="xref" href="ec-upgrade-deployment.html" title="Upgrade versions">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>
