<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Feature usage tracking for self-service customers</strong></span>. It is now possible for customers to analyze their Elastic Cloud feature usage and choose the subscription level that best fits their needs.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Cost and usage analysis page</strong></span>. To help users better understand their costs, we have introduced a new Usage analysis page under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Account &amp; Billing</strong></span>. The Usage analysis page allows you to filter historical data and break down usage by deployment, as well as by product. For annual and overages customers, it also shows how many credits will be applied for the current bill cycle.</p>

Any deployment update executed on a monitored 7.6+ deployment will undergo a one-time rolling plan change to transition the deployment to Metricbeat-based monitoring.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Allow Kibana CORS settings on Cloud.</strong></span> Cloud adds Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support for Kibana with the following settings:
<code class="literal">server.cors.enabled</code> - Set to <code class="literal">true</code> to allow cross-origin API calls. Default: <code class="literal">false</code>.
<code class="literal">server.cors.allowCredentials</code> - Set to <code class="literal">true</code> to allow browser code to access the response body whenever the request is performed with user credentials. Default: <code class="literal">false</code>.
<code class="literal">server.cors.allowOrigin</code> - List of origins permitted to access resources. You must specify <code class="literal">server.cors.allowOrigin</code> when <code class="literal">server.cors.allowCredentials: true</code>. Default: ["*"]</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Remove subscription from the user menu.</strong></span> The subscription level badge is removed from the user menu. Users should navigate to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Account &amp; Billing</strong></span> to view their subscription level.</p>
