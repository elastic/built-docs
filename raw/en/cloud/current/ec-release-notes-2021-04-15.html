<h3><a id="ec_bug_fixes_27"></a>Bug fixes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-87/docs/saas/releases/ms-55.0/bug.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fixed an issue where the coordinating tier wasn&#8217;t displayed in the architecture summary.</strong></span> Makes sure that the coordinating tier appears in the deployment architecture summary.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fixed warning when logs and metrics are disabled.</strong></span> Prevents a false negative warning "Resource plans are inconsistent with deployment logging and metrics settings. Please reapply desired settings" that was shown after disabling deployment logs and metrics.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Removed 0 size option for warm and cold tiers.</strong></span> Removes the ability to set a 0 size on warm and cold tiers, if they are already sized when autoscaling is turned on. Removing warm and cold tiers is not supported as a safe operation.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Removed padding from Reset credentials modal.</strong></span> There was a minor UI bug that led to the <code class="literal">elastic</code> credentials showing without left padding in the Reset credentials modal.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>More selective voting exclusions.</strong></span> Fixes a bug that added voting exclusions to Elasticsearch master nodes unnecessarily during forced restarts, sometimes leading to plan failures later.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Failure to delete nodes with voting exclusions.</strong></span> Cleans up any stray nodes with any lingering voting exclusions at the end of a plan change for 7.x Elasticsearch clusters to prevent future plans from failing.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Deleted trusted deployments still displayed.</strong></span> Fixes a UI bug in trust management, which resulted in a permanent loading state once a trusted deployment was deleted.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Removed a Workplace Search document thumbnail setting.</strong></span> For 7.10.x deployments, a setting was displayed that enabled a thumbnail for synced documents. This setting was not available at that version and is now available 7.11.x and newer.</p>
