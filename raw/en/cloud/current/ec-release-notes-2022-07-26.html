<p>The following changes are included in this release.</p>
<h3><a id="ec_features_8"></a>Features<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-87/docs/saas/releases/ms-77.0/feature.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Enable self-monitoring on deployment creation.</strong></span> Extension to the <a class="xref" href="Deployment_-_CRUD.html#create-deployment" title="Create Deployment">Create Deployment</a> API call: The <a class="xref" href="definitions.html#DeploymentObservabilitySettings" title="DeploymentObservabilitySettings">observability destination</a> for logging and metrics can now also be set to <em>self</em>. This way it is possible to create a deployment with log and metrics delivery already enabled to itself.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add name to account trust.</strong></span> Added a name property to the <code class="literal">AccountTrustRelationship</code> setting used for configuring <a class="xref" href="ec-trust-management.html" title="Trust management">Trust management</a>. This enables trust to be configured based on an organization name.</p>
<h3><a id="ec_enhancements_9"></a>Enhancements<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-87/docs/saas/releases/ms-77.0/enhancement.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Rename <code class="literal">upstream</code> to <code class="literal">backend</code>.</strong></span> Renamed <code class="literal">upstream_proto</code> in the Proxy logs to <code class="literal">backend_proto</code> to maintain consistency with other Proxy log fields relating to the connection between the Proxy and the stack components. <code class="literal">upstream_dialer</code> has also been renamed to <code class="literal">backend_dialer</code> for the same reason.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Change frozen nodes and cache storage wording.</strong></span> Changed the UI wording on frozen instances to clarify how much of the blob storage is full, based on the disk storage.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add description, size, and last modified to the table for extensions.</strong></span> Added three new fields to the table showing your deployment extensions. You can now see the description field, the size of the extension, and when it was last modified.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Allow list Kibana setting "migrations.discardCorruptObjects: text".</strong></span> When upgrading the stack, Kibana runs a migration process to ensure system indices are up-to-date with the newer version. Sometimes, migrations might fail due to data inconsistencies. For instance if corrupt objects exist or transform errors occur during a migration, this will cause the migration to fail.</p>
<p>This version adds support for the new <code class="literal">migrations.discardCorruptObjects</code> flag. This flag tells Kibana to discard corrupt saved objects that can be found during a migration, as well as transform errors, logging a warning message and carrying on with the migration process.</p>
<p>Note that this flag must be set to the target version, that is, the version to which the stack is being upgraded. For instance, if you are upgrading to 8.4.0, you must set <code class="literal">migrations.discardCorruptObjects: "8.4.0"</code> in order for the flag to be taken into account. This is a safeguard that prevents Kibana to systematically ignore / discard unknown objects in future migrations, in case users forget to disable the flag after a migration.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>TermQuery.value is not an object type.</strong></span> Updated the Swagger type of TermQuery.value to <code class="literal">string</code>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Don&#8217;t send payload on console API if it&#8217;s empty strings.</strong></span> Fixed a bug in the API console where <code class="literal">content-type</code> was being sent when no body existed in the API request.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Fix trust UI issue for multiple trusted deployments.</strong></span> Fixed an issue where trusting more than one specific deployment would lead to those deployments being listed as <code class="literal">(deleted)</code> in the deployment trust UI.</p>
