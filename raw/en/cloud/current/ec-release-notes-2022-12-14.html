<p>The following changes are included in this release.</p>
<h3><a id="ec_features_6"></a>Features<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-91/docs/saas/releases/ms-84.0/feature.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Faster recovery</strong></span> Depending on instance type and container size, Elasticsearch instances will now recover faster. This applies to Elasticsearch version 8.1 and later.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Added an API endpoint where organizations can claim their private link</strong></span> Added an API endpoint where organizations can claim their private link (AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private Link, or GCP Private Service Connect). Only the owner of the private link can use the private link in a traffic filter, reducing the risk of data exfiltration.</p>
<h3><a id="ec_enhancements_6"></a>Enhancements<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-91/docs/saas/releases/ms-84.0/enhancement.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Set default APM client timeout to 1800s (30m).</strong></span> The default APM client timeout is now to 1800s (30m).</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add Kibana <code class="literal">server.compression.brotli.enabled</code> setting to allowlist.</strong></span> For  version <code class="literal">8.6</code> and higher of the Elastic Stack, you can now enable brotli compression format for the Kibana server by using the <code class="literal">server.compression.brotli.enabled</code> Kibana user setting.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Avoid App.tsx mounting on URL change.</strong></span> Avoid App.tsx mounting on URL change. This resolves an issue with the appearance of breadcrumbs in the Elasticsearch Service UI.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>vCPU information available in autoscaling user interface for Machine Learning.</strong></span> The autoscaling user interface now shows the minimum vCPU values for Machine Learning instances, plus the amount it can be boosted up to for small instances.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Email notifications use a default connector.</strong></span> Kibana can send notifications to users in multiple scenarios. Some examples include <em>case assignment</em> and <em>@mentioning</em>. To that end,  Kibana version 8.6.0 and later includes a new <code class="literal">'notifications'</code> plugin, which exposes a simple email service to send email notifications. This service uses the default email service that is provided by the Elasticsearch Service.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Compile glossaries</strong></span> To make all Elastic terminology easier to find, we&#8217;ve compiled the multiple glossaries into a single <a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack-glossary/current/terms.html" class="ulink" target="_top">comprehensive glossary</a> that compiles entries from across all Elastic products and solutions, including those from the former Elasticsearch Service glossary.</p>
<h3><a id="ec_bug_fixes_4"></a>Bug fixes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-91/docs/saas/releases/ms-84.0/bug.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Convert <code class="literal">int_server</code> to APM when vacating those nodes from the Deployment page.</strong></span> Fixed a bug whereby Integrations Server instances were not able to be moved from one allocator to another, if the action was taken from the Deployment page.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Support extensions with compressed zip entries.</strong></span> Fixed a bug in uploading extensions compressed by Mac OS Finder.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Rewrite the helper function to take into account the current plan.</strong></span> Fixed a bug where removing a topology element in the Edit page would lead to a warning about elements already existing in the deployment. This was a false positive.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>The <code class="literal">v1/logs/_search endpoint</code> now shows total search hits.</strong></span> A <code class="literal">total</code> field has been added to the deployment log search responses. This indicates the pagination required to get through the results.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Rename JVM keystore configs in Elasticsearch cluster data.</strong></span> The <code class="literal">trust.jvm_trust_store</code> and <code class="literal">trust.jvm_store_pass</code> Elasticsearch cluster data settings have been renamed to <code class="literal">jvm_trust_store.name</code> and <code class="literal">jvm_trust_store.password</code>, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add step to remove route-server certs on disk prior to recreating route-server and restarting proxy.</strong></span> The certificate rotation script has been updated to remove proxy/route-server certificates on disk when they are expiring to allow newly created certs to be written back to disk upon route-server start-up.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Remove elevate endpoint.</strong></span> The <code class="literal">/api/v1/users/auth/_elevate</code> endpoint has been removed in this release.</p>
<h3><a id="ec_deprecations_2"></a>Deprecations<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-91/docs/saas/releases/ms-84.0/deprecation.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>End of Cloud UI Support for managing Shield users.</strong></span> For Elasticsearch versions before 5.0, users and roles are configured in the Cloud UI Shield user editor. However, in order to support our upcoming changes for role-based access control (RBAC), we are planning to discontinue the legacy APIs that this editor uses. As of the end of January 2023, version 2.4 deployments will no longer be able to edit these users and roles via the Cloud UI.</p>
