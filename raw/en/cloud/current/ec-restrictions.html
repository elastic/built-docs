<p>The following restrictions apply when using APIs in Elasticsearch Service:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Elasticsearch Service API
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The Elasticsearch Service API is subject to a restriction on the volume of API requests that can be submitted per user, per second. Check <a class="xref" href="ec-api-rate-limiting.html" title="Rate limiting">Rate limiting</a> for details.

</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The Elasticsearch APIs do not natively enforce rate limiting. However, all requests to the Elasticsearch cluster are subject to Elasticsearch configuration settings, such as the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.13/modules-network.html#http-settings" class="ulink" target="_top">network HTTP setting</a> <code class="literal">http:max_content_length</code> which restricts the maximum size of an HTTP request body. This setting has a default value of 100MB, hence restricting API request payloads to that size. This setting is not currently configurable in Elasticsearch Service. For a list of which Elasticsearch settings are supported on Cloud, check <a class="xref" href="ec-add-user-settings.html" title="Edit Elasticsearch user settings">Add Elasticsearch user settings</a>. To learn about using the Elasticsearch APIs in Elasticsearch Service, check <a class="xref" href="ec-api-console.html" title="Access the Elasticsearch API console">Access the Elasticsearch API console</a>.

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The transport client is not considered thread safe in a cloud environment. We recommend that you use the Java REST client instead. This restriction relates to the fact that your deployments hosted on Elasticsearch Service are behind proxies, which prevent the transport client from communicating directly with Elasticsearch clusters.

The transport client is not supported over <a class="xref" href="ec-traffic-filtering-vpc.html" title="AWS PrivateLink traffic filters">private link connections</a>. Use the Java REST client instead, or connect over the public internet.

<li class="listitem">
The transport client does not work with Elasticsearch clusters at version 7.6 and later that are hosted on Cloud. Transport client continues to work with Elasticsearch clusters at version 7.5 and earlier. Note that the transport client was deprecated with version 7.0 and will be removed with 8.0.

Some Elasticsearch plugins do not apply to Elasticsearch Service. For example, you won&#8217;t ever need to change discovery, as Elasticsearch Service handles how nodes discover one another.

<li class="listitem">
In Elasticsearch 5.0 and later, site plugins are no longer supported. This change does not affect the site plugins Elasticsearch Service might provide out of the box, such as Kopf or Head, since these site plugins are serviced by our proxies and not Elasticsearch itself.

<p>Watcher encryption Key Setup is not supported.</p>
<p>Changing the default throttle period is not possible. You can specify a throttle period per watch, however.</p>
<p>Watcher comes preconfigured with a directly usable email account provided by Elastic. However, this account can&#8217;t be reconfigured and is subject to some limitations. For more information on the limits of the Elastic mail server, check the <a class="xref" href="ec-watcher.html#ec-cloud-email-service-limits" title="Cloud email service limits">cloud email service limits</a></p>

<p>Currently you can&#8217;t use SSO to login directly from Elastic Cloud into Kibana endpoints that are protected by Private Link traffic filters. However, you can still SSO into Private Link protected Kibana endpoints individually using the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.13/saml-guide-stack.html" class="ulink" target="_top">SAML</a> or <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.13/oidc-guide.html" class="ulink" target="_top">OIDC</a> protocol from your own identity provider, just not through the Elastic Cloud console. Stack level authentication using the Elasticsearch username and password should also work with <code class="literal">{kibana-id}.{vpce|privatelink|psc}.domain</code> URLs.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t set the Watcher webhook target to a deployment protected by traffic filters. This restriction also applies to <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.13/automating-report-generation.html#use-watcher" class="ulink" target="_top">generating PDFs</a> using Watcher. Public webhooks such as Slack, PagerDuty, and email are not affected by this limitation. You can use the <code class="literal">xpack.notification.webhook.additional_token_enabled</code> configuration setting available in Elastic Stack versions 8.7.1 and later to bypass traffic filters.</p>

The maximum size of a single Kibana instance is 8GB. This means, Kibana instances can be scaled up to 8GB before they are scaled out. For example, when creating a deployment with a Kibana instance of size 16GB, then 2x8GB instances are created. If you face performance issues with Kibana PNG or PDF reports, the recommendations are to create multiple, smaller dashboards to export the data, or to use a third party browser extension for exporting the dashboard in the format you need.

<p>Enterprise Search&#8217;s management interface in Kibana does not work with traffic filters with 8.3.1 and older, it will return an <code class="literal">Insufficient permissions</code> (403 Forbidden) error.

<p>Kibana and Enterprise Search do not currently support restoring a snapshot of their indices across Elastic Cloud deployments.</p>
<p><a href="/guide/en/kibana/current/using-kibana-with-security.html#security-configure-settings" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana uses encryption keys</a> in various places, ranging from encrypting data in some areas of reporting, alerts, actions, connector tokens, ingest outputs used in Fleet and Synthetics monitoring to user sessions.</p>
<p><a href="/guide/en/enterprise-search/current/encryption-keys.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Enterprise Search uses encryption keys</a> when storing content source synchronization credentials, API tokens and other sensitive information.</p>
<p>Currently, there is not a way to retrieve the values of Kibana and Enterprise Search encryption keys, or set them in the target deployment before restoring a snapshot. As a result, once a snapshot is restored, Kibana and Enterprise Search will not be able to decrypt the data required for some Kibana and Enterprise Search features to function properly in the target deployment.</p>
<p>If you have already restored a snapshot across deployments and now have broken Kibana saved objects or Enterprise Search features in the target deployment, you will have to recreate all broken configurations and objects, or create a new setup in the target deployment instead of using snapshot restore.</p>

<p>There are situations where you may need or want to move your installed Elastic Agents from being managed in one deployment to being managed in another deployment.</p>
<p>In Elastic Cloud, you can migrate your Elastic Agents by taking a snapshot of your source deployment, and restoring it on a target deployment.</p>
<p>To make a seamless migration, after restoring from a snapshot there are some additional steps required, such as updating settings and resetting the agent policy.
