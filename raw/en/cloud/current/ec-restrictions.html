<p>The following restrictions apply when using APIs in Elasticsearch Service:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Elasticsearch Service API
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The Elasticsearch Service API is subject to a restriction on the volume of API requests that can be submitted per user, per second. Check <a class="xref" href="ec-api-rate-limiting.html" title="Rate limiting">Rate limiting</a> for details.
</dd>
</dl>

<a id="ec-restrictions-apis-elasticsearch"></a>
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Elasticsearch APIs
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The Elasticsearch APIs do not natively enforce rate limiting. However, all requests to the Elasticsearch cluster are subject to Elasticsearch configuration settings, such as the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.6/modules-network.html#http-settings" class="ulink" target="_top">network HTTP setting</a> <code class="literal">http:max_content_length</code> which restricts the maximum size of an HTTP request body. This setting has a default value of 100MB, hence restricting API request payloads to that size. This setting is not currently configurable in Elasticsearch Service. For a list of which Elasticsearch settings are supported on Cloud, check <a class="xref" href="ec-add-user-settings.html" title="Edit Elasticsearch user settings">Add Elasticsearch user settings</a>. To learn about using the Elasticsearch APIs in Elasticsearch Service, check <a class="xref" href="ec-api-console.html" title="Access the Elasticsearch API console">Access the Elasticsearch API console</a>. And, for full details about the Elasticsearch APIs and their endpoints, check the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.6/rest-apis.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch API reference documentation</a>.

There are no rate limits restricting your use of the Kibana APIs. However, Kibana features are affected by the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.6/settings.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana configuration settings</a>, not all of which are supported in Elasticsearch Service. For a list of what settings are currently supported, check <a class="xref" href="ec-manage-kibana-settings.html" title="Edit Kibana user settings">Add Kibana user settings</a>.

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The transport client is not considered thread safe in a cloud environment. We recommend that you use the Java REST client instead. This restriction relates to the fact that your deployments hosted on Elasticsearch Service are behind proxies, which prevent the transport client from communicating directly with Elasticsearch clusters.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The transport client is not supported over <a class="xref" href="ec-traffic-filtering-vpc.html" title="AWS PrivateLink traffic filters">private link connections</a>. Use the Java REST client instead, or connect over the public internet.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The transport client does not work with Elasticsearch clusters at version 7.6 and later that are hosted on Cloud. Transport client continues to work with Elasticsearch clusters at version 7.5 and earlier. Note that the transport client was deprecated with version 7.0 and will be removed with 8.0.

Some Elasticsearch plugins do not apply to Elasticsearch Service. For example, you won&#8217;t ever need to change discovery, as Elasticsearch Service handles how nodes discover one another.

In Elasticsearch 5.0 and later, site plugins are no longer supported. This change does not affect the site plugins Elasticsearch Service might provide out of the box, such as Kopf or Head, since these site plugins are serviced by our proxies and not Elasticsearch itself.

In Elasticsearch 5.0 and later, site plugins such as Kopf and Paramedic are no longer provided. We recommend that you use our <a class="xref" href="ec-monitoring.html" title="Keeping your deployment healthy">cluster performance metrics</a>, <a class="xref" href="ec-monitoring.html" title="Keeping your deployment healthy">X-Pack monitoring features</a> and Kibana&#8217;s (6.3+) <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.6/index-mgmt.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Index Management UI</a> if you want more detailed information or perform index management actions.

<p>You can&#8217;t set the Watcher webhook target to a deployment protected by traffic filters.

<p>Enterprise Search&#8217;s management interface in Kibana does not work with traffic filters with 8.3.1 and older, it will return an <code class="literal">Insufficient permissions</code> (403 Forbidden) error.

<p>Kibana and Enterprise Search do not currently support restoring a snapshot of their indices across Elastic Cloud deployments.</p>
<p><a href="/guide/en/kibana/current/using-kibana-with-security.html#security-configure-settings" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana uses encryption keys</a> in various places, ranging from encrypting data in some areas of reporting, alerts, actions, connector tokens, ingest outputs used in Fleet and Synthetics monitoring to user sessions.</p>
<p><a href="/guide/en/enterprise-search/current/encryption-keys.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Enterprise Search uses encryption keys</a> when storing content source synchronization credentials, API tokens and other sensitive information.</p>
<p>Currently, there is not a way to retrieve the values of Kibana and Enterprise Search encryption keys, or set them in the target deployment before restoring a snapshot. As a result, once a snapshot is restored, Kibana and Enterprise Search will not be able to decrypt the data required for some Kibana and Enterprise Search features to function properly in the target deployment.</p>
<p>If you have already restored a snapshot across deployments and now have broken Kibana saved objects or Enterprise Search features in the target deployment, contact <a href="https://support.elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Support</a> for assistance.</p>

There is a known problem affecting clusters with versions 7.7.0 and 7.7.1 due to <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56739" class="ulink" target="_top">a bug in Elasticsearch</a>.
Although rare, this bug can prevent you from running plans. If this occurs we recommend that you retry the plan, and if that fails please contact support to get your plan through.
Because of this bug we recommend you to upgrade to version 7.8 and higher, where the problem has already been addressed.
