<p>In order to establish a remote connection between two remote clusters, they must both trust each other. Trust is bi-directional: If one of the clusters doesn&#8217;t trust the other, the remote connection won&#8217;t be established.</p>
<p>Mutual trust between two clusters is required to <a class="xref" href="ec-enable-ccs.html" title="Enable cross-cluster search and cross-cluster replication">enable cross-cluster search and cross-cluster replication</a>.</p>
<p>Trust can be configured individually for each deployment.</p>

<p>By default, any deployment that you create trusts all other deployments in the same organization.
