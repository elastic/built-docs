<p>An AutoOps event provides a detailed analysis of a specific issue, including why it was triggered and the steps needed to resolve it.
The following sections provide you with comprehensive insights and context around issues, the reasons why the event was created, as well as the affected nodes and indices with high indexing activity.</p>

<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="ec-autoops-what-was-detected"></a>What was detected</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-119/docs/shared/ec-ce-autoops-events.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>This section describes the reasons for which the event was created, as well as links to drill down into the issue.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="ec-autoops-recommendations"></a>Recommendations</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-119/docs/shared/ec-ce-autoops-events.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>AutoOps provides a set of recommendations. The sequence of their appearance indicates the suggested order of steps to address the issue.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="ec-autoops-event-duration"></a>Event duration</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-119/docs/shared/ec-ce-autoops-events.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>The time the event was detected (opened at) and the time AutoOps identified that the issue no longer exists (closed at). The closing of an event does not necessarily indicate that the customer resolved the issue, but rather that AutoOps no longer detects it.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="ec-autoops-background-impact"></a>Background and impact</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-119/docs/shared/ec-ce-autoops-events.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Provides background and context as to why an event is important, and the impact it can have on performance and stability.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="ec-autoops-event-timeline"></a>Event timeline chart</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-119/docs/shared/ec-ce-autoops-events.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>This chart visually represents metrics related to an issue. It appears only for events with dynamic metrics. For example, load issues will have this section, while settings-related issues will not. The event timeline chart displays just the last 15 minutes.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="ec-autoops-event-severity"></a>Event severity</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-119/docs/shared/ec-ce-autoops-events.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Events are categorized into three levels of severity - high, medium, and low - based on their potential impact on cluster performance and stability:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>High</strong></span>: Events can immediately cause significant usability, performance and stability problems.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Medium</strong></span>: Events may lead to severe problems if not addressed.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Low</strong></span>: Events have minimal/not urgent impact.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="ec-autoops-event-customize"></a>Event settings</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-119/docs/shared/ec-ce-autoops-events.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>AutoOps events are set to <code class="literal">open</code> and <code class="literal">close</code> based on triggering mechanisms that have default settings for each event type. You can modify the default settings through the Customize option in the event settings. Be cautious while changing these settings, to avoid situations where alerts fail to trigger.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="ec-autoops-notifications"></a>Notifications</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-119/docs/shared/ec-ce-autoops-events.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>AutoOps can send notifications to a variety of operation management tools like PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Slack, Teams and custom webhooks. Refer to <a class="xref" href="ec-autoops-notifications-settings.html" title="Notifications settings">Notifications settings</a> for more details.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="ec-autoops-event-sharing"></a>Sharing events with others</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-119/docs/shared/ec-ce-autoops-events.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>You can easily share event information with other users by sending them a direct link to the AutoOps event using the share event link located at the top right of the event window.</p>
<p>Only users with access to the AutoOps deployment from which the link was copied can view the event details.</p>
