<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elasticsearch is now offered as a native service in the Azure console.</strong></span> This deep integration provides consolidated billing with your Azure bill, simplified data ingestion for Azure logs and metrics, support for Private Link, and more.</p>
<p>You can immediately <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/elastic.ec-azure-pp" class="ulink" target="_top">create Elasticsearch resources in Azure now</a>, or learn more about the integration in our <a class="xref" href="ec-azure-marketplace-native.html" title="Native Azure integration">Native Azure integration documentation</a>.</p>

<p>You can subscribe to Elasticsearch Service directly from the Azure Marketplace. You then have the convenience of viewing your Elasticsearch Service subscription as part of your Azure bill, and you do not have to supply any additional credit card information to Elastic.</p>
<p>Some differences exist when when you subscribe to Elasticsearch Service through the Azure Marketplace:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Previous Elasticsearch Service accounts cannot be converted to use the Azure Marketplace. <span class="strong strong"><strong>If you already have an account, you must use a different email address when you sign up for a subscription through the Azure Marketplace.</strong></span>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
There is no trial period. Billing starts when you subscribe to Elasticsearch Service.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Pricing for an Elasticsearch Service subscription through the Azure Marketplace differs from our direct billing model and follows the pricing outlined on the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/pricing" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service pricing calculator</a>. Pricing is based on the Azure region, the depoyment capacity, billed per hour, as well as some other parameters such as data transfer out, data transfer internode, snapshot storage and snapshot APIs. For more details, see <a class="xref" href="ec-billing-dimensions.html" title="Billing Dimensions">Billing Dimensions</a>.

</ul>

<p>Note the following items before you subscribe:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You cannot use an email address that already has an Elastic Cloud account. If you want to use the same account email address with Azure Marketplace billing, you must first change the email address on your existing account before setting up your new Azure Marketplace subscription. For instructions on how to change your email address in Elastic Cloud, see <a class="xref" href="ec-account-user-settings.html#ec-update-email-address" title="Update your email address">update your email address</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
You may be prompted from within the Azure Marketplace to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal" class="ulink" target="_top">set up a resource group</a>. This is a standard part of the subscription process in Azure to help organize your resources.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
You may be prompted from within the Azure Marketplace for administrator approval. In this case, your Azure administrator must ensure that the Azure Policy permits the purchasing of marketplace offers. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/marketplace-faq-publisher-guide#what-could-block-a-customer-from-completing-a-purchase" class="ulink" target="_top">What could block a customer from completing a purchase?</a> in the Azure Marketplace documentation.

<p>If you see the Elastic Cloud login page after clicking through from the Azure console, then an Elastic Cloud account is already connected to your marketplace subscription.

<p>This message is returned when you have already provisioned a marketplace subscription under your Azure user account. Each Azure user account can only subscribe to Elastic Cloud once. If you attempt to create multiple marketplace subscriptions, this error is shown when you attempt to configure your subscription in Elastic Cloud.</p>
<p>If you wish to configure multiple marketplace subscriptions, you need to use a different Azure user account to create the marketplace subscription from the Azure console. Once the marketplace subscription has been created in Azure, you can continue to configure the subscription in Elastic Cloud.</p>
