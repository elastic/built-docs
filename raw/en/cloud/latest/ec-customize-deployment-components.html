<p>When you create or edit an existing deployment, you can fine-tune the capacity, add extensions, and select additional features.</p>
<h4><a id="ec-customize-autoscaling"></a>Autoscaling<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-84/docs/shared/ec-ce-getting-started-customize.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Autoscaling reduces some of the manual effort required to manage a deployment by adjusting the capacity as demands on the deployment change. Currently, autoscaling is supported to scale Elasticsearch data tiers upwards, and to scale machine learning nodes both upwards and downwards. Check <a class="xref" href="ec-autoscaling.html" title="Deployment autoscaling">Deployment autoscaling</a> to learn more.</p>
<h4><a id="ec-cluster-size"></a>Elasticsearch<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-84/docs/shared/ec-ce-getting-started-customize.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Depending upon how much data you have and what queries you plan to run, you need to select a cluster size that fits your needs. There is no silver bullet for deciding how much memory you need other than simply testing it. The
<a class="xref" href="ec-monitoring.html" title="Keeping your deployment healthy">cluster performance metrics</a>
in the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Console</a> can tell you if your cluster is sized appropriately. You can also <a class="xref" href="ec-enable-logging-and-monitoring.html" title="Enable logging and monitoring">enable deployment monitoring</a> for more detailed performance metrics. Fortunately, you can change the amount of memory allocated to the cluster later without any downtime for HA deployments.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>You cannot select a specific instance and remove it in Cloud. To change the cluster topology, go to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Deployment &gt; Edit</strong></span>, select a storage and RAM setting from the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Size per zone</strong></span> drop-down list, and save your changes. When downsizing the cluster, make sure to have enough resources to handle the current load, otherwise your cluster will be under stress.</p>

<p>For trials, larger sizes are not available until you <a class="xref" href="ec-billing-details.html" title="Add your billing details">add a credit card</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, half the memory is assigned to the JVM heap. For example, on a 32 GB cluster, 16 GB are allotted to heap. The disk-to-RAM ratio currently is 1:24, meaning that you get 24 GB of storage space for each 1 GB of RAM. All clusters are backed by SSD drives.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>For production systems, we recommend not using less than 4 GB of RAM for your cluster, which assigns 2 GB to the JVM heap.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The CPU resources assigned to a cluster are relative to the size of your cluster, meaning that a 32 GB cluster gets twice as much CPU resources as a 16 GB cluster. All clusters are guaranteed their share of CPU resources, as we do not overcommit resources. Smaller clusters up to and including 8 GB of RAM benefit from temporary CPU boosting to improve performance when needed most.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to autoscale your deployment, you can manually increase or decrease capacity by adjusting the size of hot, warm, cold, and frozen <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.5/data-tiers.html" class="ulink" target="_top">data tiers</a> nodes. For example, you might want to add warm tier nodes if you have time series data that is accessed less-frequently and rarely needs to be updated. Alternatively, you might need cold tier nodes if you have time series data that is accessed occasionally and not normally updated.</p>

<h4><a id="ec-high-availability"></a>Fault tolerance<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-84/docs/shared/ec-ce-getting-started-customize.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>High availability is achieved by running a cluster with replicas in multiple data centers (availability zones), to prevent against downtime when infrastructure problems occur or when resizing or upgrading deployments. We offer the options of running in one, two, or three data centers.</p>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ec-fault-tolerance.png" alt="High availability features">
</div>
</div>
<p>Running in two data centers or availability zones is our default high availability configuration. It provides reasonably high protection against infrastructure failures and intermittent network problems. You might want three data centers if you need even higher fault tolerance. Just one zone might be sufficient, if the cluster is mainly used for testing or development.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Some <a class="xref" href="ec-reference-regions.html" title="Elasticsearch Service regions">regions</a> might have only two availability zones.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Like many other changes, you change the level of fault tolerance while the cluster is running. For example, when you prepare a new cluster for production use, you can first run it in a single data center and then add another data center right before deploying to production.</p>
<p>While multiple data centers or availability zones increase a cluster&#8217;s fault tolerance, they do not protect against problematic searches that cause nodes to run out of memory, for example. For a cluster to be highly reliable and available, it is also <a href="/blog/found-elasticsearch-in-production?q=elasticsearch%20in%20prod#memory" class="ulink" target="_top">important to have enough memory</a>.</p>
<p>The node capacity you chose is per data center. The reason for this is that there is no point in having two data centers if the failure of one will result in a cascading error because the remaining data center cannot handle the total load. Through the allocation awareness in Elasticsearch, we configure the nodes so that your Elasticsearch cluster will automatically allocate replicas between each availability zone</p>
<p>Our article on <a href="/blog/found-elasticsearch-in-production?q=elasticsearch%20in%20prod#networking" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch in Production</a> covers availability zones and resilience against infrastructure failures in more detail.</p>
<h4><a id="ec-scripting"></a>Scripting<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-84/docs/shared/ec-ce-getting-started-customize.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The defaults for the different supported script types are generally safe to accept as is, unless you have a specific requirement. The script_fields in filters and facets are one of the features that make Elasticsearch so flexible, but they can allow arbitrary code execution, like <code class="literal">Runtime.exec("cat /etc/passwd")</code> and other malicious operations.</p>
<p>For each supported script type, you have three levels of scripting control:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Disable the scripts completely
</li>
<li class="listitem">

<p>You can review your Elasticsearch shard activity from Elasticsearch Service. At the bottom of the Elasticsearch page, you can hover over each part of the shard visualization for specific numbers.</p>
<div class="imageblock">

<p>Lists the official plugins available for your selected Elasticsearch version.</p>
<p>When selecting a plugin from this list you get a version that has been tested with the chosen Elasticsearch version. The main difference between selecting a plugin from this list and uploading the same plugin as a custom extension is in who decides the version used. To learn more, check
<a class="xref" href="ec-adding-plugins.html" title="Add plugins and extensions">Add plugins</a>.</p>
<p>The reason we do not list the version chosen on this page is because we reserve the option to change it when necessary. That said, we will not force a cluster restart for a simple plugin upgrade unless there are severe issues with the current version. In most cases, plugin upgrades are applied lazily, in other words when something else forces a restart like you changing the plan or Elasticsearch runs out of memory.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded any custom plugins, user bundles with dictionaries or scripts, should appear on the list and this where you choose to enable them for the cluster.</p>
<div class="tip admon">

<p>For new deployments that use Elasticsearch version 5.0 and later, we automatically create a Kibana instance for you.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If you use a version before 5.0 or if your cluster didn&#8217;t include a Kibana instance initially, there might not be a Kibana endpoint URL shown, yet. To enable Kibana, select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enable</strong></span>. Enabling Kibana provides you with an endpoint URL, where you can access Kibana. It can take a short while to provision Kibana right after you select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enable</strong></span>, so if you get an error message when you first access the endpoint URL, try again.</p>

</div>
<p>*Log in to Kibana with the <code class="literal">elastic</code> superuser to try it out. The password was provided when you created your cluster or
<a class="xref" href="ec-password-reset.html" title="Reset the elastic user password">can be reset</a>.
 For version 7.9.2 and later, you can go straight into Kibana with single sign-on (SSO).</p>
<p>In production systems, you might need to control what Elasticsearch data users can access through Kibana, so you need to create credentials that can be used to access the necessary Elasticsearch resources. This means granting read access to the necessary indexes, as well as access to update the <code class="literal">.kibana</code> index.</p>
