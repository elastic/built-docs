<span class="term">
<a id="faq-payment"></a>What are the available payment methods on Elasticsearch Service?
</span>

For month-to-month payments only credit cards are accepted. We also allow payments by bank transfer for annual subscriptions.

<span class="term">
<a id="faq-contact"></a>Who can I contact for more information?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
If you have any further questions about your credit card statement, billing, or receipts, please send an email to <a href="mailto:ar@elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">ar@elastic.co</a> or open a <a class="xref" href="ec-get-help.html" title="Getting help">Support case</a> using the <em>Billing issue</em> category.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-charge"></a>Why is my credit card charged?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
If you are on a monthly plan, the charge is a recurring fee for using our hosted Elasticsearch Service. The fee is normally charged at the start of each month, but it can also be charged at other times during the month. If a charge is unsuccessful, we will try to charge your card again at a later date.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-when"></a>When is my credit card charged?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
You are billed on the first day of each month for usage in the prior month.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-whystillcharged"></a>Why is my credit card charged if I canceled my trial?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
If you add a credit card to your Elastic Cloud account at any time during the trial period, the trial is converted to a paid subscription. You then have to pay for any expense incurred by your deployment beginning when the credit card was added. If you delete your deployment at a later date, you will still be invoiced for any usage that occurs between the conversion date and the deployment deletion date.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-cancelpolicy"></a>What is the cancellation policy for monthly subscriptions?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
There are no cancellation or termination fees for monthly subscriptions. If the service is no longer needed, you can spin down all of your deployments. Usage for that month will be billed at the end of the month in your final bill.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-chargednotusing"></a>Why am I being charged if I don’t use any of my deployments?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Even if you have no activity on your account and you haven&#8217;t logged into the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Console</a>, your active deployments still incur costs that we need to charge you for. To avoid being charged for active but unused deployments, you can simply delete them. Your account will stay active with no charges, and you can always spin up more capacity when you need it.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-deleteaccount"></a>How can I delete my Elastic Cloud account?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
To have your account removed, you can contact support through the Elasticsearch Service <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/support?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Support form</a> or use one of these <a class="xref" href="ec-get-help.html" title="Getting help">alternative contact methods</a>. For details about our data erasure policy, check <a href="/legal/privacy-statement#privacy-rights-and-choices?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Privacy Rights and Choices</a> in our General Privacy Statement.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-refund"></a>Can I get a refund?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Charges are non-refundable, but once you delete a deployment we&#8217;ll stop charging you for that deployment immediately. You only pay for what you use and you can stop using the service at any time. For any special considerations warranting a potential refund, please use the Elasticsearch Service Console <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/support?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Support form</a> to open a support case and select <em>Billing issue</em> as the category. To ensure quick processing, be sure to provide detail about the reasons for the refund request as well as other matters pertaining to the issue.

<p>The following section applies to annual contracts that are billed on the prepaid consumption billing model.</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-channels"></a>What purchasing channels can be used for prepaid consumption credits?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The prepaid consumption billing model is currently only available for Elastic Direct customers - customers who are purchasing directly from Elastic. This offering may expand to marketplace customers in the future.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-migration"></a>Can I migrate my monthly account to the prepaid consumption model?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Yes, if you have a monthly Elasticsearch Service account, you can <a href="/cloud/contact" class="ulink" target="_top">contact us</a> to migrate to prepaid consumption.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-depletion"></a>What happens if my credits are depleted mid-year?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
If your credit balance is depleted during the contract year, you will receive overage invoices for the on-demand usage. Overages are typically billed at list prices in ECU, and then invoiced at the list price currency equivalent.
If your deal is a multi-year contract and you are not in its last year, or if you have signed a future renewal of your contract, the overages will be discounted with the same rate as the current contract year.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-expiration"></a>What happens to credits that have an expiration date during a billing cycle?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
You can consume credits that have an expiration date in a given month until the end of that month, which effectively means you are getting up to a 30-day grace period.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-draw-credits"></a>If I have a multi-year contract and I run out of balance, can I draw against the next year’s credits?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
No, this option is currently not available.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-organizations"></a>If my user login is invited to a different organization, what happens to the prepaid credits for the current organization?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Prepaid credits are always assigned to a given organization and NOT to a specific user account. If a user is invited to a different organization, they will not carry the prepaid credits to the new organization.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-level"></a>What kind of subscription level can a customer have on the prepaid consumption model?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
When the credits are first provisioned, your Cloud account will be set to Enterprise. You can <a class="xref" href="ec-select-subscription-level.html" title="Choose a subscription level">change your subscription level</a> at any time. We are offering only Gold, Platinum, and Enterprise support levels for prepaid consumption customers. Standard is not offered for prepaid consumption.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-usage"></a>Where can I follow the remaining balance and usage?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The current usage and remaining balance can be found in the <a class="xref" href="ec-account-usage.html" title="Monitor and analyze your account usage">Usage</a> page. You will also receive monthly usage statements that are published in the <a class="xref" href="ec-billing-history.html" title="Check your billing history">Billing history</a> page.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-notification"></a>How will I know that I am running out of credits?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Your account billing contacts and the members of your organization will receive email notifications when your credit balance falls below 33%, 25%, and 16% of credits remaining.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-overages"></a>How can I pay for overages?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
We only support PO (invoicing) for overages for prepaid consumption customers. The issued invoices include tax.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-lapse"></a>What happens when a prepaid consumption contract expires and is not renewed?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Your Elastic Cloud account will automatically change into a monthly account, paid through PO (invoicing). You will continue to incur costs, as we will not delete any of your deployments. You will not benefit from any discount because monthly customers are billed at list prices.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-credits"></a>If credits are purchased through multiple orders, which ones get used first?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Credits get consumed in the order of expiration (first expired - first used). If two or more order lines have the same expiration date, the one with the highest discount is consumed first. If there are two or more order lines with the same discount, then the one with the lower balance is consumed first.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="faq-prepaidcover"></a>What do the prepaid credits cover?
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
If you have an annual contract, your prepaid credits are used to cover all usage, including capacity, data transfer, and snapshot storage.
