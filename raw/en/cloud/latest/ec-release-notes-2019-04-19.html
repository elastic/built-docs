<p>Elasticsearch Service now supports additional features that let you do more with our hosted offering:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Support for the index lifecycle management (ILM) feature of the Elastic Stack.</strong></span> If you are using the Elastic Stack 6.7 or later, ILM provides an integrated and streamlined way to manage time-based data, making it easier to follow best practices for managing your indices. For example: You can automate how Elasticsearch Service manages indices and apply operations, such as index relocation, force merging, and index shrinking.

<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Migration to hot-warm architecture</strong></span>. Elasticsearch Service now supports migrating some existing deployments to a hot-warm architecture. If you have a deployment that is getting overwhelmed by the volume of incoming data or that contains logging data that doesn&#8217;t all need to be on fast storage, you might be able to migrate your deployment to a hot-warm architecture by adding another data configuration.
