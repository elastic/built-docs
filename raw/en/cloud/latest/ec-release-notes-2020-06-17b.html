<p>Elasticsearch Service now supports additional features that let you do more with our hosted offering:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Support for new security setting.</strong></span> The <code class="literal">xpack.http.ssl.cipher_suites</code> setting is now enabled for Elasticsearch Service. This setting can be useful when using outgoing TLS traffic to external services with restrictive supported cipher suites. One example would be using Telegram from Watcher.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>In-place configuration changes.</strong></span> In-place changes for existing deployments substantially speed up configuration changes and are now the default for most operations that involve settings changes, upgrades, and deployment resizing. The benefits include:</p>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Reduced wait times
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Reduced chance of plan failures and improved platform stability
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Reduced data transfer charges from the cloud platform provider, proportional to the amount of data you manage in your deployment
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The speed and reliability of in-place configuration changes comes from applying the changes to the existing instances of your deployment, such as the Elasticsearch nodes and Kibana instances, followed by a rolling restart. There is no downtime for highly available deployments with two or more availability zones, provided that deployments are sized to support their workloads.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch Service previously used only a grow-and-shrink approach for deployment changes. This approach adds new instances, migrates data from old instances to the new ones, and then shrinks the deployment by removing the old instances. Grow-and-shrink provides high availability during configuration changes even for single availability zones. The tradeoff is that changes frequently require replacing some or all of the deployment, triggering a potentially long-running data migration process for larger deployments.</p>
<p>When you change your deployment configuration, Elasticsearch Service will choose the right approach to apply the changes, using either the preferred in-place approach where possible or falling back to grow-and-shrink when necessary.  Deployment changes that will continue to require a grow-and-shrink approach include:</p>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Configuration changes and upgrades to non-highly available deployments that use only one availability zone
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Changes to APM and Kibana instances
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When applying changes to non-highly available deployments, the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&amp;placement=docs-body" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Console</a> now warns you that your deployment may suffer a temporary loss of availability. If loss of availability is not acceptable, make sure to use at least two availability zones, even if only temporarily. Keep in mind that production systems should never use only one availability zone.</p>
<p>The grow-and-shrink approach may still be used in some other scenarios, for example when the host that your deployment runs on has insufficient capacity to scale up an Elasticsearch cluster and needs to use capacity on another host.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>New deployment templates to support AWS M5d and R5d hardware.</strong></span> AWS provides memory- and CPU-optimised machines with attached NVMe storage instead of GP2 which offers more performant hardware with better disk performance. In order to support the new hardware, you can now make use of updated AWS deployment templates. The new templates still use the same naming convention and replace components using R4 with R5d, and M5 with M5d.</p>

<p>Prices for the new hardware are marginally higher. You can check the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/pricing" class="ulink" target="_top">pricing calculator</a> for exact prices.</p>
<p>New deployments will use the AWS M5d and R5d hardware by default. For existing deployments, there is currently no direct migration path, but you can make use of the new hardware by <a class="xref" href="ec-create-deployment.html" title="Create a hosted deployment">creating a new deployment</a> and then <a class="xref" href="ec-restore-across-clusters.html" title="Restore a snapshot across clusters">restoring your data</a> from a snapshot.</p>

<h3><a id="ec_breaking_changes_6"></a>Breaking Changes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-111/docs/saas/ec-release-notes-to-ms-48.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>This version includes the following breaking changes:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Elasticsearch clusters provisioned prior to January 25th, 2019 have a CORS policy set at the proxy layer. This policy is now deprecated and we will be moving to a model that requires you to configure your own http module CORS policy. The <code class="literal">http.cors.*</code> settings are <a class="xref" href="ec-add-user-settings.html" title="Edit Elasticsearch user settings">configurable as Elasticsearch user settings</a> for all of your deployments.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If your use case depends on the ability to receive CORS requests and you have an Elasticsearch cluster that was provisioned prior to January 25th 2019, you must manually apply the <code class="literal">http.cors.*</code> settings before the September 22 deadline, or you will potentially have an operational impact.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>The in-place configuration change improvements included in this release mean that single availability zone deployments will be temporarily unavailable while the change is applied. If availability is a concern, you should use two availability zones for your deployment, which requires no downtime and which ensures deployment availability during future configuration changes, upgrades, and hardware failures.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>As a best practice for production setups, you should never run with a single availability zone if downtime is a concern.</p>

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Traffic filters must not be enabled on monitoring clusters. If you are shipping your logs or metrics to a monitoring cluster, do not associate traffic filters with the Elasticsearch cluster you are sending the logs or metrics to. Since you cannot explicitly allow traffic from certain clusters currently, associating traffic filters with your monitoring cluster will result in clusters being blocked when sending data.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
A <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56739" class="ulink" target="_top">known bug in Elasticsearch</a> affects clusters with versions 7.7.0 and 7.7.1 and can prevent you from making configuration changes. If this problem occurs, we recommend that you retry the configuration change. If retrying the change fails please contact Support. We also recommend that you to upgrade to version 7.8 or higher, where the problem has been addressed.
