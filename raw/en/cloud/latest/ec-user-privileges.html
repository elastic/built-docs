They are also able to sign on to deployments with superuser privileges.
</li>

<p>You can set instance access roles:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
globally, for all hosted deployments. In this case, the role will also apply to new deployments created later.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
individually, for specific deployments only. To do that, you have to set the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Role for all instances</strong></span> field of that specific instance type to <span class="strong strong"><strong>None</strong></span>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For hosted deployments, the predefined roles available are the following:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Admin</strong></span> - Can manage deployment details, properties and security privileges, and is able to sign on to the deployment with superuser privileges. This role can be scoped to one or more deployments. In order to prevent scope expansion, only Admins on all deployments can create new deployments.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Editor</strong></span> - Has the same rights as Admin, except from deployment creation and management of security privileges. Editors are able to sign on to the deployment with the “editor” stack role. This role can be scoped to one or more deployments.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Viewer</strong></span> - Can view deployments, and can sign on to the deployment with the viewer Stack role. This role can be scoped to one or more deployments.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Within the same organization, all members share the same set of default permissions. From the Elasticsearch Service main page you can:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">

See the organization details.

<li class="listitem">

<h3><a id="ec-role-scoping"></a>Role scoping<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-110/docs/saas/ec-organizations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Roles are assigned to every member of an organization and can refer (or be scoped) to one or more specific deployments, or all deployments. When a role is scoped to all deployments it grants permissions on all existing and future deployments.</p>
<p>This list describes the scope of the different roles:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Organization owner</strong></span> - This role is always scoped to administer all deployments.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Billing admin</strong></span> - This role does not refer to any deployment.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Admin</strong></span>, <span class="strong strong"><strong>Editor</strong></span>, and <span class="strong strong"><strong>Viewer</strong></span> - These roles can be scoped to either all deployments, or specific deployments.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Members are only able to see the role assignments of other members under the organization they belong to, for role assignments they are able to manage. Members with the Organization owner role assigned are able to see the role assignments of every member of their organization.</p>
<p>Members with the Admin role assigned are able to see role assignments for deployments within their scope. For example, Admins of all deployments are able to see role assignments scoped to all and specific deployments in the organization, while Admins of specific deployments only see role assignments scoped to those specific deployments. This ensures that members assigned to specific deployments do not try to remove role assignments from other members, and that the existence of other deployments are not revealed to these members.</p>
<h3><a id="ec-stack-user-org-member"></a>Mapping of Elastic Cloud roles with Elastic Stack roles<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-110/docs/saas/ec-organizations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>There are two ways for a user to access Kibana instances of an Elastic Cloud deployment:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Directly with Elasticsearch credentials. In this case, users and their roles are managed directly in <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.15/using-kibana-with-security.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana</a>. Users in this case don&#8217;t need to be members of the Elastic Cloud organization to access the deployment. Note that if you have several deployments, you need to manage users for each of them, individually.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Through your Elastic Cloud organization. In this case, users who are members of your organization log in to Elastic Cloud and can open the deployments they have access to. Their access level is determined by the roles assigned to them from the Organization page. Elastic Cloud roles are mapped to <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/built-in-roles.html#built-in-roles" class="ulink" target="_top">Stack roles</a> on a per-deployment level. When logging in to a specific deployment, users get the Stack role that maps to their Cloud role for that particular deployment.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The following table shows the default mapping:</p>
<div class="informaltable">
