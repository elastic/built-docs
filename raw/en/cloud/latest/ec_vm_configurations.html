<p>For the AWS infrastructure upgrade, we use the default instance type configurations provided by AWS which are unique to them.</p>
<p>To make it easy to identify each instance type in AWS, a new common nomenclature is introduced.</p>
<p>For example, Instance ID / SKU: <code class="literal">aws.es.datahot.i3</code></p>
<div class="informaltable">
<table border="1" cellpadding="4px">
<colgroup>
<col class="col_1"/>
<col class="col_2"/>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p><code class="literal">aws.*</code></p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p>Denotes the cloud provider, AWS in this case with Azure in future cases.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p><code class="literal">\*.es.datahot.*</code></p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p>Denotes that this configuration is an Elasticsearch (<code class="literal">es</code>) cluster component that serves as a data node for hot content. Other options may be <code class="literal">datawarm</code>, <code class="literal">datacold</code>, <code class="literal">datafrozen</code> for data nodes, and <code class="literal">kibana</code>, <code class="literal">master</code>, and so on for other components.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p><code class="literal">*.i3</code></p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p>Denotes that this configuration is running on the AWS i3 instance family.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>The new configuration naming convention aligns with the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/data-tiers.html" class="ulink" target="_top">data tiers</a> intended for each configuration type, replacing prior naming conventions of “highio”, “highcpu”, and so on.
The following table details the new configurations for data nodes and compares them with prior naming conventions where applicable.</p>

<p>For a detailed price list, check the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/deployment-pricing-table?provider=aws" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Cloud price list</a>.
For a detailed specification of the new configurations, check <a class="xref" href="ec-default-aws-configurations.html" title="Elasticsearch Service AWS default provider instance configurations">Elasticsearch Service default provider instance configurations</a>.</p>
<p>The benefits of the new configurations are multifold:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
By providing a net new configuration of C5d instances, there is a general boost of performance related to new chipsets and faster hardware. On average the boost we witnessed in select benchmarks can reach up to 15%, however, different workloads may exhibit different improvements.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Introducing C6gd, M6gd &amp; R6gd instances, powered by AWS Graviton 2, provides high compute coupled with fast NVMe storage and offer more than a 20% improvement in price-performance over comparable Intel chipsets.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The existing family types have been extended in terms of disk capacity which translates to a more cost effective infrastructure which in some cases can save up to 80% when calculating cost by disk capacity.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
There are now more instance types to choose from in the hot tier.  Rather than the traditional “highio” and “highcpu”, there are now six options to cover the hot data tier which allows to optimize cost/performance further.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In addition to data nodes for storage and search, Elasticsearch nodes also have machine learning nodes, master nodes, and coordinating nodes. These auxiliary node types along with application nodes such as APM servers, Kibana, and Enterprise search have also been upgraded to the new C5d, C6gd, M5d, and M6gd instance types. Both auxiliary node and application node configurations are based on Elasticsearch data node configuration types shown in the previous table.</p>
