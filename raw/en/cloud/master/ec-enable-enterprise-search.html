<p>Enterprise Search is built on top of Elasticsearch to deliver a rich, pre-tuned search experience. Enterprise Search includes:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
App Search - provide your applications with a rich, out-out-the-box search capability.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Workplace Search - unify all the content platforms across your organization into a personalized search experience.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To set up Enterprise Search:</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>While you can enable <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enterprise Search</strong></span> using the <span class="strong strong"><strong>General purpose</strong></span> (previously known as <span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Stack</strong></span>), <span class="strong strong"><strong>Observability</strong></span>, or <span class="strong strong"><strong>Security</strong></span> deployment templates, these configurations are not precisely tuned for the Enterprise Search use case. For production workloads, use the Enterprise Search deployment template for maximum performance and stability.</p>

First, <a class="xref" href="ec-create-deployment.html" title="Create a deployment">create a new deployment</a> with the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enterprise Search</strong></span> solution. This is available starting in Elastic Stack version 7.7.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
When the deployment has spun up, make a note of the user account and password, and store it in a safe place. You can use this account and password to connect to Enterprise Search through its dedicated UI.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Launch Enterprise Search directly from the main deployment page, or select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enterprise Search</strong></span> under the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Deployments</strong></span> menu to find more options. From the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enterprise Search</strong></span> pane you can force a restart, terminate, or delete the Enterprise Search instance.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>When the Enterprise Search window opens, enter the <code class="literal">elastic</code> user and password for this deployment to login, and then select to use either App Search or Workplace Search.</p>
<div class="tip admon">

<div class="admon_content">
<p>You can configure Enterprise Search to use a SAML identity provider for cross-domain, single sign-on authentication. To learn how, check <a class="xref" href="ec-securing-clusters-SAML.html" title="Secure your clusters with SAML">Secure your clusters with SAML</a>.</p>

<li class="listitem">
Follow the UI instructions in the selected product to complete your setup.

<p>Now that your Enterprise Search instance is set up, learn more about it by following the Enterprise Search Reference <a href="/guide/en/enterprise-search/current/index.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Getting Started</a> documentation.</p>
<div class="note admon">

<div class="admon_content">
<p>If Enterprise Search is left at the default size, and has no engines or sources configured for an extended period, it will be automatically disabled.
This occurs whether <a class="xref" href="ec-autoscaling.html" title="Deployment autoscaling">autoscaling</a> is enabled or not.</p>

<h3><a id="ec-upgrade-appsearch2"></a>Upgrade App Search to Enterprise Search<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/master/docs/shared/ec-ce-upgrade-appsearch.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Beginning with Elastic Stack version 7.7, App Search and Workplace Search are bundled together. The two components are available as a single Elastic Enterprise Search deployment.</p>
<p>The process of migrating data does not require read downtime, but like a typical product upgrade it does require write downtime. To ensure data integrity during the upgrade process App Search is set to <a class="xref" href="ec-enable-enterprise-search.html#ec-appsearch-readonly2" title="Read-only mode">read-only mode</a>.</p>
<p>We have built a nice assistant to help you migrate your App Search deployment to Enterprise Search, to enjoy all the new features it provides.</p>
<p>To upgrade your App Search deployment to Enterprise Search:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Log in to the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Console</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Select the App Search deployment you want to upgrade to Enterprise Search.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Upgrade</strong></span> and then in the dialog that opens choose <span class="strong strong"><strong>Start migration</strong></span>. An assistant opens to help you safely migrate to Enterprise Search.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Follow the steps in the assistant:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Set read-only mode</strong></span>. This prevents data from being written to the App Search instance while it is being migrated.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Take a snapshot</strong></span> of your current App Search data. This can take several minutes. The assistant indicates when the snapshot has completed.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Create a deployment</strong></span> from the snapshot. A new Enterprise Search deployment is created with all of the settings and data from the previous App Search deployment.</p>
<p>Once the new Enterprise Search deployment has spun up, validate that the App Search data is available. Do any performance, functional, or other tests that you might need. Once you are ready, move to the next step.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Migrate your application</strong></span>. Configure the credentials and URL for the new deployment in all of your applications.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Finally, you can decommission the App Search deployment since you have successfully migrated to Enterprise Search with all of your data preserved.

<p>App Search and Enterprise Search support a read-only mode, which allows a product operator to disable all writes from the application to the underlying Elasticsearch instance while keeping the application running and handling search requests. This mode could be used to perform maintenance on a deployment, create a consistent snapshot of the deployment’s data, or to perform an <a class="xref" href="ec-enable-enterprise-search.html#ec-upgrade-appsearch2" title="Upgrade App Search to Enterprise Search">product upgrade</a> without downtime.</p>
