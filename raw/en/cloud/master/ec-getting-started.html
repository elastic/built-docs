<h2><a id="ec_what_is_elasticsearch_service"></a>What is Elasticsearch Service?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/master/docs/shared/ec-ce-getting-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>The Elastic Stack, managed through Elastic Cloud deployments.</strong></span></p>
<p>Elasticsearch Service allows you to manage one or more instances of the Elastic Stack through <span class="strong strong"><strong>deployments</strong></span>.
These deployments are hosted on Elastic Cloud, through the cloud provider and regions of your choice, and are tied to your organization account.</p>
<p>A <em>deployment</em> helps you manage an Elasticsearch cluster and instances of other Elastic products, like Kibana or APM instances, in one place. Spin up, scale, upgrade, and delete your Elastic Stack products without having to manage each one separately. In a deployment, everything works together.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Hardware profiles to optimize deployments for your usage.</strong></span></p>
<p>You can optimize the configuration and performance of a deployment by selecting a <span class="strong strong"><strong>hardware profile</strong></span> that matches your usage.</p>
<p><em>Hardware profiles</em> are presets that provide a unique blend of storage, memory and vCPU for each component of a deployment. They support a specific purpose, such as a hot-warm architecture that helps you manage your data storage retention.</p>
<p>You can use these presets, or start from them to get the unique configuration you need. They can vary slightly from one cloud provider or region to another to align with the available virtual hardware.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Solutions to help you make the most out of your data in each deployment.</strong></span></p>
<p>Building a rich search experience, gaining actionable insight into your environment, or protecting your systems and endpoints? You can implement each of these major use cases, and more, with the solutions that are pre-built in each Elastic deployment.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>These solutions help you accomplish your use cases: Ingest data into the deployment and set up specific capabilities of the Elastic Stack.</p>
<p>Of course, you can choose to follow your own path and use Elastic components available in your deployment to ingest, visualize, and analyze your data independently from solutions.</p>
