<p>Traffic filtering is one of the security layers available in Elasticsearch Service. It allows you to limit how your deployments can be accessed. Add another layer of security to your installation and deployments by restricting inbound traffic to <em>only</em> the sources that you trust.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch Service supports the following traffic sources:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="ec-traffic-filtering-ip.html" title="IP traffic filters">IP addresses and Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) masks</a>, e.g. <code class="literal">82.102.25.74</code> or <code class="literal">199.226.244.0/24</code>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">

</div>
<p>Filtering rules are grouped into rule sets, which in turn are associated with one or more deployments to take effect. Traffic between the instances in your deployment is automatically allowed.</p>
<p>Traffic filter operates on the proxy. Requests rejected by the traffic filter are not forwarded to the deployment. The proxy responds to the client with <code class="literal">403 Forbidden</code>.</p>

<div class="admon_content">

<h3><a id="ec-traffic-filter-how-does-it-work"></a>How does it work?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/master/docs/shared/ec-ce-traffic-filtering-deployment-configuration.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>By default, all your deployments are accessible over the public internet. They are not accessible over unknown PrivateLink connections.</p>
<p>Once you associate at least one traffic filter with a deployment, traffic that does not match any rules (for this deployment) is denied.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>This only applies to external traffic. Internal traffic is managed by Elasticsearch Service. For example, Kibana can connect to Elasticsearch, as well as internal services which manage the deployment. Other deployments can&#8217;t connect to deployments protected by traffic filters.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can assign multiple rule sets to a single deployment. The rule sets can be of  different types.</p>
<p>In case of multiple rule sets, traffic can match ANY of them. If none of the rule sets match the request is rejected with <code class="literal">403 Forbidden</code>.</p>
<p>You can mark a rule set as <em>default</em>. It is automatically attached to all new deployments that you create in its region. You can detach default rule sets from deployments after they are created.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>A <em>default</em> rule set is not automatically attached to existing deployments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For more information about creating and editing rule sets and then associating them with your deployments, read more about <a class="xref" href="ec-traffic-filtering-ip.html" title="IP traffic filters">IP addresses and CIDR masks</a>, <a class="xref" href="ec-traffic-filtering-vpc.html" title="AWS PrivateLink traffic filters">AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) over AWS PrivateLink</a>, <a class="xref" href="ec-traffic-filtering-vnet.html" title="Azure Private Link traffic filters">Azure VNets over Azure Private Link</a>, or <a class="xref" href="ec-traffic-filtering-psc.html" title="GCP Private Service Connect traffic filters">GCP Private Service Connect</a>.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Traffic filter rule sets are bound to a single region. The rule sets can be assigned only to deployments in the same region. If you want to associate a rule set with deployments in multiple regions you have to create the same rule set in all the regions you want to apply it to.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Traffic filter rule sets when associated with a deployment will apply to all deployment endpoints, such as Elasticsearch, Kibana, APM Server, and others.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Any traffic filter rule set assigned to a deployment overrides the default behavior of <em>allow all access over the public internet endpoint; deny all access over Private Link</em>. The implication is that if you make a mistake putting in the traffic source (for example, specified the wrong IP address) the deployment will be effectively locked down to any of your traffic. You can use the UI to adjust or remove the rule sets.</p>

<p>Jane creates a deployment. At this point the deployment is accessible over internet through its public endpoint, e.g. <code class="literal">https://fcd41689e9214319b1278325fd6af7cd.us-east-1.aws.found.io</code>. The deployment is protected by username+password authentication, but there&#8217;s no additional traffic source filtering.</p>
<p>Jane wants to restrict access to the deployment so that only the traffic originating from Jane&#8217;s VPC is allowed.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
They create a Traffic Filter <em>Private Link Endpoint</em> rule set, thus registering their VPC with Elasticsearch Service.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
They associate this rule set with the deployment.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
At this point, their deployment is only accessible over PrivateLink from Jane&#8217;s VPC. This does not affect other security layers, so Jane&#8217;s users need to authenticate with username+password.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The deployment is no longer accessible over the public internet endpoint.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Later on, Jane wants to allow access to the deployment from Jane&#8217;s Office.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
They create an IP rule set with office IP range give as a CIDR mask, e.g. <code class="literal">199.226.244.0/24</code>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
They attach the rule set to the deployment.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The deployment is accessible from Jane&#8217;s VPC and from Jane&#8217;s Office.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Finally, Jane decides to allow anyone to connect to the deployment over the public internet.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
They create the <em>allow all</em> rule set, with the CIDR mask <code class="literal">0.0.0.0/0</code>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
They associate it with Jane&#8217;s deployment.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Anyone with a valid username+password can now access the deployment.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
They could remove the Jane&#8217;s Office rule set&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<code class="literal">199.226.244.0/24</code>. It is a subset of the <em>allow all</em>. They prefer to keep it attached anyways, in case they need to deny access from the public internet in the future.
