<p>The X-Pack monitoring features let you monitor Elasticsearch through Kibana. You can view your cluster’s health and performance in real time and analyze past cluster, index, and node metrics. In Elasticsearch versions before 5.0, Marvel provides similar monitoring functionality.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>In Elasticsearch 5.0 and later, the monitoring features of Marvel became part of <a href="/guide/en/x-pack/6.2/xpack-introduction.html" class="ulink" target="_top">X-Pack</a>. If you are using an Elasticsearch version before 5.0, think <em>Marvel</em> whenever you read about the X-Pack monitoring features.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Monitoring consists of three components:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
A Monitoring agent that is installed on each node in your Elasticsearch cluster. The Monitoring agent collects and indexes metrics from Elasticsearch, either on the same cluster or by sending metrics to an external monitoring cluster. Elasticsearch Service manages the installation and configuration of the monitoring agent for you, and you should not modify any of the settings.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The Metrics page of the Cloud Console.  Each Elasticsearch Service deployment has a Metrics page that provides CPU, request count, response time, indexing, memory, disk, and garbage collection metrics.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The Monitoring (formerly Marvel) application plugin in <a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.9/introduction.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana</a> that visualizes the monitoring metrics through a dashboard.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a id="ec-enable-monitoring-limitations"></a>Before you begin</h3>
<p>Some limitations apply when you use monitoring on Elasticsearch Service. To learn more, see <a class="xref" href="ec-restrictions.html#ec-restrictions-monitoring" title="Monitoring">Monitoring (Restrictions and known problems)</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="ec-monitoring-production"></a>Monitoring for production use</h3>
<p>For production use, you should log your Elasticsearch cluster metrics to a dedicated monitoring cluster. Monitoring indexes metrics into Elasticsearch and these indexes consume storage, memory, and CPU cycles like any other index. By using a separate monitoring cluster, you avoid affecting your other production clusters.</p>
<p>How many monitoring clusters you use depends on your requirements:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You can ship metrics for many clusters to a single monitoring cluster, if your business requirements permit it.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
While monitoring will work with a cluster running a single node, you need a minimum of three monitoring nodes to make monitoring highly available.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>You might need to create dedicated monitoring clusters for isolation purposes in some cases. For example:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
If you have many clusters and some of them are much larger than others, creating separate monitoring clusters prevents a large cluster from potentially affecting monitoring performance for smaller clusters.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you need to silo Elasticsearch data for different business departments. Clusters that have been configured to ship metrics to a target monitoring cluster have access to indexing data and can manage monitoring index templates, which is addressed by creating separate monitoring clusters.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Monitoring data that gets sent to a dedicated monitoring Elasticsearch cluster <a class="xref" href="ec-enable-monitoring.html#ec-monitoring-retention" title="Retention of monitoring daily indices">is not cleaned up automatically</a> and might require some additional steps to remove excess data periodically.</p>
<h3><a id="ec-monitoring-retention"></a>Retention of monitoring daily indices</h3>
<p>When you enable monitoring in Elasticsearch Service by configuring your cluster <span class="strong strong"><strong>to send monitoring data to itself</strong></span>, your monitoring indices are retained for a certain period by default. After the retention period has passed, the monitoring indices are deleted automatically. The retention period when a cluster sends monitoring data to itself depends on the version of Elasticsearch:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
For Elasticsearch 5.x clusters: Monitoring data is retained for three days by default or as specified by the <a class="xref" href="ec-add-user-settings.html#xpack-monitoring-history-duration"><code class="literal">xpack.monitoring.history.duration</code> user setting</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When <a class="xref" href="ec-enable-monitoring.html#ec-monitoring-production" title="Monitoring for production use">monitoring for production use</a>, where you configure your clusters <span class="strong strong"><strong>to send monitoring data to a dedicated monitoring cluster</strong></span> for indexing, this retention period does not apply. Monitoring indices on a dedicated monitoring cluster are retained until you remove them. There are two options open to you:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
To enable the automatic deletion of monitoring indices from dedicated monitoring clusters, <a class="xref" href="ec-enable-monitoring.html#ec-enable-monitoring-steps" title="Enable monitoring">enable monitoring</a> on your dedicated monitoring cluster in Elasticsearch Service to send monitoring data to itself. When an Elasticsearch cluster sends monitoring data to itself, all monitoring indices are deleted automatically after the retention period, regardless of the origin of the monitoring data.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To retain monitoring indices on a dedicated monitoring cluster as is without deleting them automatically, no additional steps are required other than making sure that you do not enable the monitoring cluster to send monitoring data to itself. You should also monitor the cluster for disk space usage and upgrade your cluster periodically, if necessary.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a id="ec-index-management-curator"></a>Index management using Curator</h3>
<p>For long-term index management, you can run <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/index.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Curator</a> on-premise to manage indices on Elasticsearch Service. For example, you can use Curator to clean up monitoring indices like any other time-based index.</p>
<p>Tips for using Curator with Elasticsearch Service:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Be sure to configure your <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/configfile.html#hosts" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">curator.yml</code></a> file to point to your Elasticsearch Service cluster.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To clean up monitoring indices, use the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/delete_indices.html" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">delete_indices</code></a> action. You can refer to this <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/ex_delete_indices.html#ex_delete_indices" class="ulink" target="_top">delete_indices example</a> as a guide or use our <a class="xref" href="ec-enable-monitoring.html#ec-index-management-curator-example" title="Example: Metricbeat indices">Metricbeat example</a> in this section.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
For connections to Elasticsearch Service, there may be proxy level timeout issues, if you do not set <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/option_timeout_override.html" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">timeout_override</code></a> parameter; this means that Curator will take the timeout as a cancelation of that task (which is still running on the cluster itself).  Alternatively, you could script running cURL commands using the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/indices-delete-index.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Delete Index API</a> that connect to your Elasticsearch Service cluster.

<h3><a id="ec-enable-monitoring-steps"></a>Enable monitoring</h3>
<p>Elasticsearch Service manages the installation and configuration of the Monitoring agent (formerly Marvel) for you. When you enable Monitoring on an Elasticsearch cluster, you are configuring where the monitoring agent for your current cluster should send its metrics.</p>
<p>To enable the Monitoring agent:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">

<h3><a id="ec-access-kibana-monitoring"></a>Access the Monitoring application in Kibana</h3>

<h3><a id="ec-saas-metrics-x-pack"></a>Monitoring clusters in Elasticsearch Service</h3>
<p>Detailed monitoring information is available through the X-Pack monitoring features (called Marvel in versions before 5.0), but some monitoring information reports only host-level statistics and not container statistics. Because your Elasticsearch cluster nodes run within containers on Elasticsearch Service, some system metrics do not reflect the utilization for your cluster nodes but rather the utilization of the host that they&#8217;re running on. We have begun to make improvements to X-Pack monitoring to show accurate metrics and, starting in version 5.2, the CPU usage and throttle times are accurately captured over time.</p>
<p>For now, the following system metrics in the Monitoring app should not be used to monitor your clusters hosted on Elasticsearch Service:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
IP address
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Reports the internal private IP address, which is not usable externally.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">

</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Reports the total free space on the host, not the storage assigned to your cluster.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">

</dt>
<dd>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
