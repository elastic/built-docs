<p>Elasticsearch Service now supports additional features that let you do more with our hosted offering:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Configure your snapshot intervals.</strong></span> You can now change the interval for your deployment snapshots from the default 30 minutes, to 4 hours or 24 hours. Elasticsearch Service still retains the 100 most recent, successful snapshots. <a class="xref" href="ec-restoring-snapshots.html" title="Work with snapshots">Learn more &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elasticsearch disk-based shard allocation is enabled by default.</strong></span> Elasticsearch Service now includes disk-based shard allocation and supports the <code class="literal">cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled</code> setting and other related settings. Disk-shard allocation is available only for new clusters. To learn more:</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>NOTE</strong></span>: The <code class="literal">cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.flood_stage</code> setting is currently affected by a bug and has no effect. For more information, refer to <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33119" class="ulink" target="_top">#33119</a>. After the bug is fixed, <code class="literal">cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.flood_stage</code> will work automatically.</p>

<span class="strong strong"><strong>Cloud UI improvements.</strong></span> With our new UI features, you can further refine your view of the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Deployments</strong></span> page by reformatting the grid view to a list and applying new filters. When you have finished refining your view, download your deployments as a JSON object or CSV list.
