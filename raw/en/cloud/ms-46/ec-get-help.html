<p>With your Elasticsearch Service subscription, you get access to support from the very creators of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, Logstash, and our commercial X-Pack plugin. We&#8217;re here to help!</p>

<p>As of May 1, 2017, support for Elasticsearch Service <span class="strong strong"><strong>Standard</strong></span> customers has moved from the Discuss forum to our link: <a href="https://support.elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Support Portal</a>. You should receive login instructions by email. We will also monitor the forum and help you get into the support portal, in case you&#8217;re unsure where to go.</p>

<h3><a id="ec_how_do_i_open_a_support_case"></a>How do I open a support case?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/cloud/edit/ms-46/docs/saas/ec-support.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>There are three ways you can open a support case:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Use the Elasticsearch Service Console: <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/help" class="ulink" target="_top">Support form</a></p>
<p>For Trial and Standard subscriptions, completing the form automatically opens a support case for you, including your contact details and Elasticsearch Service account. You can help us help you by selecting the category that applies your issue and giving us more details about the situation in the description. If the issue relates to a specific deployment, the name or ID is required. If you have a Premium subscription, you should continue to use the support portal with its additional capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Contact us by email: <a href="mailto:support@elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">support@elastic.co</a></p>
<p>If you contact us by email, please use the email address that you registered with, so that we can help you more quickly. If you are using a distribution list as your registered email, you can also register a second email address with us. Just open a case to let us know the name and email address you would like to be added.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Go to the support portal: <a href="http://support.elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">http://support.elastic.co</a></p>
<p>As an Elasticsearch Service customer, you will receive an email with instructions how to log in to the support portal, where you can track both current and archived cases. If you are a new customer who just signed up for Elasticsearch Service, it can take a few hours for your support portal access to be set up. If you have questions in the meantime, you can always reach out to us at <a href="mailto:support@elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">support@elastic.co</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When opening a case, there are a few things you can do to get help faster:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Include the deployment ID that you want help with, especially if you have several deployments. The deployment ID can be found on the overview page for your cluster in the
the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service Console</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Describe the problem. Include any relevant details, including error messages you encountered, dates and times when the problem occurred, or anything else you think might be helpful.
</li>
</ul>
