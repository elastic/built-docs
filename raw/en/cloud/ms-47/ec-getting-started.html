<p>Using Elasticsearch Service is a great way to take advantage of all the power that Elastic offers. Make your data work for you, faster.</p>
<p>A <em>deployment</em> helps you manage an Elasticsearch cluster and other Elastic products, like Kibana or APM instances, in one place. Spin up, scale, upgrade, and delete your Elastic products without having to manage each one separately.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch Service includes <em>solutions</em> for your most common concerns. You can get a rich search experience with Elastic Enterprise Search, gain actionable insight into your environment with Elastic Observability, and protect your systems and endpoints with Elastic Security. We’ve done the hard work of knowing what works best, for you.</p>
<p>These solutions are deployments that combine specific hardware profiles and guide you through ingesting data into the deployment. Our <em>hardware profiles</em> support a specific purpose, such as a hot-warm architecture that helps you manage your data storage retention. All of these are based on <em>deployment templates</em>, which are a reusable configuration of Elastic products that you can deploy. With the flexibility of Elastic, you can take it a step further by customizing a deployment template to your own needs.</p>
<p>We know that use cases come in all shapes and sizes. The purpose of Elasticsearch Service is to work for yours.</p>
