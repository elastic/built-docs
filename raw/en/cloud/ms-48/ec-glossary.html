<span class="term">
<a id="allocator"></a>allocator
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Manages hosts that contain Elasticsearch and Kibana nodes. Controls the lifecycle of these nodes by creating new <a class="xref" href="ec-glossary.html#container">containers</a> and managing the nodes within these containers when requested. Used to scale the capacity of your Elasticsearch Service installation.

<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="apm"></a>APM Server
</span>
</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="zone"></a>availability zone
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Contains resources available to an Elasticsearch Service installation that are isolated from other availability zones to safeguard against failure. Could be a rack, a server zone, or some other logical constraint that creates a failure boundary. In a highly available cluster, the nodes of a cluster are spread across two or three availability zones to ensure that the cluster can survive the failure of an entire availability zone.

<span class="term">
<a id="hardware-profile"></a>hardware profile
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A built-in <a class="xref" href="ec-glossary.html#deployment-template">template</a> that supports a specific use case for the Elastic Stack, such as a cluster with a hot-warm architecture.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="instance"></a>instance
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A product from the Elastic Stack that is running in a deployment, such as an Elasticsearch node or a Kibana instance. When you choose more <a class="xref" href="ec-glossary.html#zone">availability zones</a>, the system automatically creates more instances for you.

<span class="term">
<a id="master-node"></a>master node
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Responsible for cluster-wide actions, such as creating or deleting an index, tracking which nodes are part of the cluster, and deciding which shards to allocate to which nodes. Improves the resilience of Elasticsearch, but does not handle requests and does not hold any data. Master nodes need fewer CPU and memory resources and less storage than other nodes. Also see <a class="xref" href="ec-glossary.html#node">node</a> in this glossary and <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/modules-node.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Node</a> in the Elasticsearch documentation.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="node"></a>node
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A running instance of Elasticsearch which belongs to a cluster, typically one per host. Nodes will look to discover an existing cluster by the same name when they start up and try to join that cluster.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="solution"></a>solution
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Deployments with specialized <a class="xref" href="ec-glossary.html#deployment-template">templates</a> that are pre-configured with sensible defaults and settings for common use cases.

<a id="tiebreaker"></a>tiebreaker
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Prevents cases of <a href="/blog/found-elasticsearch-in-production#split-brains" class="ulink" target="_top">split brain</a> in distributed clusters, where a cluster splits into multiple, autonomous parts that continue to handle requests independently of each other, at the risk of affecting cluster consistency and data loss. Ensures a quorum-based majority of (<em>n</em>/2)+1 nodes, where <em>n</em> is the number of nodes in the cluster. The minimum number of master nodes to reach quorum in a two-node cluster is the same as for a three-node cluster: two nodes must be available.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<a id="zookeeper"></a>ZooKeeper
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A coordination service for distributed systems used by Elasticsearch Service to store the state of the installation. Responsible for discovery of hosts, resource allocation, leader election after failure and high priority notifications.
