<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Feature usage tracking for self-service customers</strong></span>. It is now possible for customers to analyze their Elastic Cloud feature usage and choose the subscription level that best fits their needs.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Cost and usage analysis page</strong></span>. To help users better understand their costs, we have introduced a new Usage analysis page under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Account &amp; Billing</strong></span>. The Usage analysis page allows you to filter historical data and break down usage by deployment, as well as by product. For annual and overages customers, it also shows how many credits will be applied for the current bill cycle.</p>
<p>For the full list of release changes, see below.</p>
