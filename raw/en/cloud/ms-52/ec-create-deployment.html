<p>Deployments are Elastic products that you can spin up quickly and manage in the same user interface. There are <a class="xref" href="ec-getting-started-solutions.html" title="What are solutions?">preconfigured solutions for specific use cases</a>, such as search, observability, or security. If you need something else, you can customize the Elastic Stack for whatever you can dream up, using one of our <a class="xref" href="ec-getting-started-profiles.html" title="What are hardware profiles?">hardware profiles</a> as a starting point.</p>
<p>To get up and running with your deployment quickly:</p>

<p>If all you want to do is try out Elasticsearch and Kibana, the trial includes more than enough to get you started. Some of the more powerful features, such as machine learning, become available only when you add a credit card and are not free. If a feature has an <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enable</strong></span> button next to it or is greyed out, you need to <a class="xref" href="ec-billing-details.html" title="Add your billing details">add a credit card</a> to unlock the feature and pay for using it.</p>

<p>Solution options are:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">

<p>Elastic Enterprise Search comprises two products:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>App Search</strong></span> enables you to build a customized and powerful search experience in your applications.

<p>This solution includes an application server to manage queries and the search application, together with worker nodes to manage data indexing and analytics. <a class="xref" href="ec-getting-started-solutions.html#ec-getting-started-enterprise-search" title="Elastic Enterprise Search">What&#8217;s included &#8230;&#8203;</a></p>

<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Stack</strong></span></p>
<p>If you select Elastic Stack, you will also have the option to select from a number of hardware profiles. Elasticsearch Service includes the following hardware profiles:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
I/O Optimized
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Use for search and general all-purpose workloads. Provides a balance of compute, memory, and storage. If you are new to Elasticsearch or don&#8217;t need to run a more specialized workload, you can&#8217;t go wrong with this template. <a class="xref" href="ec-getting-started-profiles.html#ec-getting-started-profiles-io" title="I/O optimized profile">What&#8217;s included &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Compute Optimized
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Run CPU-intensive workloads faster. Alternatively, use this template to run smaller workloads cost-effectively when you need less memory and storage. <a class="xref" href="ec-getting-started-profiles.html#ec-getting-started-profiles-compute" title="Compute optimized profile">What&#8217;s included &#8230;&#8203;</a>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Memory Optimized
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Perform memory-intensive operations efficiently, including workloads with frequent aggregations. <a class="xref" href="ec-getting-started-profiles.html#ec-getting-started-profiles-memory" title="Memory optimized profile">What&#8217;s included &#8230;&#8203;</a>

</ul>

<p>After a deployment is spun up, you can scale the size and add other features; however, the instance configuration and computing ratios cannot be changed. If you need to change an existing deployment to another template, we recommend <a class="xref" href="ec-migrate-data.html" title="Migrating your Elasticsearch data">migrating your data</a>.</p>

Amazon Web Services (AWS)

<li class="listitem">
Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

<p>Pick a region where your deployment gets hosted.</p>
<p>A region is a geographic area where the data centers that host your deployment live. If you are not sure what to pick, select one that is close to you. To learn more about the differences between regions, see <a class="xref" href="ec-reference-regions.html" title="Elasticsearch Service regions">Elasticsearch Service Regions</a>.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Pick your Elastic Stack version, and optionally choose to restore an Elasticsearch snapshot from another deployment.</p>
<p>Restoring a snapshot can help with major version upgrades by creating a separate, non-production deployment where you can test, for example. Or, make life easier for your developers by providing them with a development environment that is populated with real data.
