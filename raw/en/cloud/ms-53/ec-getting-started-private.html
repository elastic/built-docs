<p>Elasticsearch Service Private gives you the ease of a hosted offering along with the benefits that come with having a dedicated environment to host your deployments. We provision a <em>virtual private cloud</em> (VPC) for you, that we manage for you, with an exclusive set of hosts. You can access your deployments from the public internet. Additionally, you can connect your VPC to the environment, ensuring that the traffic to the selected deployments stays within the same cloud provider and isn&#8217;t exposed to the public internet. All the deployments in the environment are available to you with consolidated billing, but you can still isolate teams or users and meter their usage separately.</p>

Which region you would like us to use to provision your Elasticsearch Service Private environment. The region must be in the same region as your VPCs.

<li class="listitem">
<p>To access your dedicated environment, you&#8217;ll need to create a new VPC endpoint and associate it with your VPC, that must be in the same <a class="xref" href="ec-regions-templates-instances.html#ec-aws_regions" title="Amazon Web Services">AWS regions</a> as your Elasticsearch Service Private environment. This is due to an AWS limitation since AWS Private Link is only supported within the same region.</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">

From the AWS user console, select the relevant region and add a VPC endpoint to initiate a connection request.

You can select which availability zones you want to enable on the endpoint. For high availability, we recommend using 2 or more availability zones.

<li class="listitem">
Update the security group associated with the Private Link endpoint to permit outbound traffic to common Elasticsearch Service ports. For example, TCP on port 9243 and 9343, as well as any CIDR ranges for the servers that need access to Elasticsearch Service.
