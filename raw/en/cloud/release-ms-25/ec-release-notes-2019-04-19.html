<span class="strong strong"><strong>Support for the index lifecycle management (ILM) feature of the Elastic Stack.</strong></span> If you are using the Elastic Stack 6.7 or later, ILM provides an integrated and streamlined way to manage time-based data, making it easier to follow best practices for managing your indices. For example: You can automate how Elasticsearch Service manages indices and apply operations, such as index relocation, force merging, and index shrinking.

<span class="strong strong"><strong>Migration to hot-warm architecture</strong></span>. Elasticsearch Service now supports migrating some existing deployments to a hot-warm architecture. If you have a deployment that is getting overwhelmed by the volume of incoming data or that contains logging data that doesn’t all need to be on fast storage, you might be able to migrate your deployment to a hot-warm architecture by adding another data configuration.
