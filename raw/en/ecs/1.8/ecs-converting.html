<p>A common schema helps you correlate and use data from various sources.</p>
<p>Fields for most Elastic modules and solutions (version 7.0 and later) are mapped
to the Elastic Common Schema. You may want to map data from other
implementations to ECS to help you correlate data across all of your products
and solutions.</p>
<p>Before you start a conversion, be sure that you understand the basics below.</p>
<h4><a id="core-or-ext"></a>Core and extended levels<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ecs/edit/1.8/docs/converting.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Make sure you understand the distinction between Core and Extended fields,
as explained in the <a class="xref" href="ecs-guidelines.html" title="Guidelines and Best Practices">Guidelines and Best Practices</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="ecs-conv"></a>An approach to mapping an existing implementation<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ecs/edit/1.8/docs/converting.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Here&#8217;s the recommended approach for converting an existing implementation to ECS.</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Review each field in your original event and map it to the relevant ECS field.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Start by mapping your field to the relevant ECS Core field.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If a relevant ECS Core field does not exist, map your field to the relevant ECS Extended field.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If no relevant ECS Extended field exists, consider keeping your field with its original details,
or possibly renaming it using ECS naming guidelines and attempt to map one
or more of your original event fields to it.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Review each ECS Core field, and attempt to populate it.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review your original event data again
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Consider populating the field based on additional meta-data such as static
information (e.g. add <code class="literal">event.category:authentication</code> even if your auth events
don&#8217;t mention the word "authentication")
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Consider capturing additional environment meta-data, such as information about the
host, container or cloud instance.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Review other extended fields from any field set you are already using, and
attempt to populate it as well.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Set <code class="literal">ecs.version</code> to the version of the schema you are conforming to. This will
allow you to upgrade your sources, pipelines and content (like dashboards)
smoothly in the future.
</li>
</ol>

<h4><a id="ecs-conv-spreasheet"></a>Using a spreadsheet to plan your migration<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ecs/edit/1.8/docs/converting.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Using a spreadsheet to plan the migration from pre-existing source fields to ECS
is a common practice. It&#8217;s a good way to address each of your fields methodically among colleagues.</p>
<p>If the data source is either a structured log, or if you already have a pipeline
producing events with these non-ECS field names, the tool
<a href="https://github.com/elastic/ecs-mapper" class="ulink" target="_top">ECS Mapper</a> may help you get started in performing all of these field renames.</p>
<p>After exporting your mapping spreadsheet to CSV, ECS Mapper will convert your field mapping
to equivalent pipelines for Beats, Elasticsearch, and Logstash. Learn more at
<a href="https://github.com/elastic/ecs-mapper" class="ulink" target="_top">ECS Mapper</a>.</p>
