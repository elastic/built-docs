<p>When upgrading to a new version of Elasticsearch, you need to upgrade
each of the products in your Elastic Stack. Beats and Logstash 5.6 are
compatible with Elasticsearch 6.0 to give you flexibility in scheduling the
upgrade.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<div class="titlepage"></div>
<p>The steps you need to take to upgrade differ depending on which products you
are using. Want a list that&#8217;s tailored to your stack? Try out our
<a href="/products/upgrade_guide" class="ulink" target="_top">Interactive Upgrade Guide</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>We recommend upgrading to the most recent 5.6 before upgrading to 6.1.4. X-Pack 5.6
provides a free Upgrade Assistant that identifies issues you need to address
before upgrading and simplifies migrating indices that need to be reindexed
before you upgrade. The Upgrade Assistant is enabled with both Trial and
Basic licenses. You can install X-Pack solely for the purpose of upgrading.
There&#8217;s no obligation to continue using X-Pack once your upgrade is complete.</p>
<p>Rolling upgrades are supported when upgrading from Elasticsearch 5.6 to
6.1.4, a full cluster restart is not always required. Upgrading from any
other version than 5.6 requires a full cluster restart.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>2.x indices are not compatible with 6.1.4. You must
remove or reindex them on 5.x before upgrading to 6.1.4. The internal
Kibana and X-Pack indices and the default Beats and Logstash mapping templates
also need to be updated to work with 6.1.4.</p>

<p>A single click in the Elastic Cloud console can upgrade a cluster to a newer
version, add more processing capacity, change plugins, and enable or disable
high availability, all at the same time. During the upgrade process,
Elasticsearch, Kibana, X-Pack and the officially included plugins are
upgraded simultaneously.</p>
<p>Although upgrading your Elastic Cloud clusters is easy, you still need to
address breaking changes that affect your application. Minor version upgrades,
upgrades from 5.6 to 6.x, and all other cluster configuration
changes can be performed with no downtime.</p>
<p>To avoid downtime when a full cluster restart is required:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Provision an additional cluster with the new Elasticsearch version, reindex
your data, and send index requests to both clusters temporarily.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Verify that the new cluster performs as expected, fix any problems, and then
permanently swap in the new cluster.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Delete the old cluster to stop incurring additional costs. You are billed
only for the time that the new cluster runs in parallel with your old cluster.
Usage is billed on an hourly basis.
