<p>This list summarizes the most important enhancements in Observability 7.16.</p>
<h2><a id="_turnkey_data_onboarding_from_aws_fargate_with_firelens"></a>Turnkey data onboarding from AWS Fargate with FireLens<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.16/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>We are excited to announce the first native integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Elastic Cloud, via AWS FireLens, a container log router for Amazon EC2 and AWS Fargate. You can now quickly and easily ingest container logs into Elastic Cloud within seconds using FireLens and Fluent Bit without needing to install and manage standalone data shippers (see <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-ecs-firelens-examples/tree/mainline/examples/fluent-bit/elastic-cloud" class="ulink" target="_top">amazon-ecs-firelens-examples</a>). The simplified data architecture also reduces operational complexities.</p>

<h2><a id="_self_managed_elastic_package_registry_is_now_ga"></a>Self-managed Elastic Package Registry is now GA<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.16/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce the general availability (GA) of our self-managed Elastic Package Registry (EPR), an OCI compliant Docker image. The Elastic Stack needs to understand the external data sources and available data formats to integrate, collect, and visualize data using Elastic Agents. Today, Kibana receives this knowledge in the form of packages from a SaaS EPR endpoint. Self-managed EPR is a standalone server that will enable the distribution of integration packages just like the existing SaaS EPR in any infrastructure setting of your choice. We know you wanted to ensure that each component of your Elastic Stack is compliant with your organization&#8217;s policies, which may include:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Operating in an air-gapped environment
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Not adopting software unless it is officially supported
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Discarding any software that cannot use custom certificates for communications
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To remove all the hurdles from your integration journey with Fleet server and Elastic Agent, we are promoting our self-managed EPR to an officially supported GA status. It can now use your custom certificates to talk to Kibana and provide the out-of-box assets and documentation for all your desired integrations.</p>
<h2><a id="_apm_server_integration_in_fleet_is_now_ga"></a>APM Server Integration in Fleet is now GA<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.16/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>This Fleet integration enables you to run an APM Server managed by Elastic Agent and Fleet. This integration uses the new data stream standard to store data.</p>
<h2><a id="_support_span_events_in_opentelemetry_traces"></a>Support span events in OpenTelemetry traces<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.16/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>OpenTelemetry span events are now available in our APM traces. Span events (distinct from spans) are structured logs that execute too quickly to be worth capturing in a traditional span, but are nevertheless important to record, such as an application exception. You can now view these exceptions, and events attached to OpenTelemetry traces, bringing greater insight to application troubleshooting.</p>
<h2><a id="_introducing_apm_compressed_spans_technical_preview"></a>Introducing APM compressed spans (technical preview)<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.16/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>This improvement significantly reduces network and storage costs associated with storing APM spans for applications with excessive database or backend calls.</p>
<h2><a id="_observability_explore_data_view_is_now_ga"></a>Observability Explore Data view is now GA<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.16/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>Have you ever had a question that you wanted to use your raw data to answer? Whether you’re trying to validate a hypothesis or simply looking for “interesting” insights in your data, having a rich tool that enables this type of data visualization and manipulation is a critical part of any analytics solution. With an initial focus on RUM, Synthetics, and Mobile APM use cases, our new Exploratory View provides a focused data exploration experience for Observability users, removing the cognitive load and complexity from performing ad-hoc analysis.</p>

<h2><a id="_servicenow_connector_certification"></a>ServiceNow connector certification<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.16/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>By integrating Elastic Observability with ServiceNow, users can standardize and streamline incident management workflows to facilitate robust collaboration within and across ITOps and DevOps teams.</p>
<p>This is now easier than ever, thanks to newly certified apps on the ServiceNow Store for the ITSM, SecOps, and ITOM (new ITOM connecter just added for 7.16) workflow platforms. Upon connecting with one or more of these apps, Elastic users have two ways to automate incident generation:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Case management integration (in technical preview for Observability) enables practitioners to escalate Elastic cases (including case details, data observables, analyst notes, and associated alarms) into ServiceNow incidents with just one click.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Alerting integration enables admins to configure forwarding of individual Elastic alerts to ServiceNow and automate the creation of corresponding ServiceNow incidents.

<p>Showing alerts with better context makes them more actionable, and enables users to start troubleshooting the issue with greater ease. With 7.16 you can click View in app on an APM alert to be taken directly to the APM UI, with the alert annotating the time series chart at the point of occurrence. Users can click the annotation in the APM UI to view further details about the alert.</p>
<p>Alert annotations are displayed by default in the APM UI charts at the point of their occurrence. Regardless of whether users have previously seen those alerts, the annotations help provide richer context and ready reference on alerts in the time range they are currently viewing.</p>

<p>In 7.16 you can view a chart for failed transaction correlations, which shows
the transactions in the overall latency distribution for the transaction group.
Both the latency and failed transaction correlation tables also have a new
option to view and add filters for the most popular field values. To learn more,
