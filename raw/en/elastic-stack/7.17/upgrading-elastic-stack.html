<p>When upgrading to a new version of Elasticsearch, you need to upgrade
each of the products in your Elastic Stack. Beats and Logstash 6.7 are
compatible with Elasticsearch 7.17.22 to give you flexibility in scheduling
the upgrade.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch supports rolling upgrades between minor versions, from Elasticsearch 5.6 to 6.8,
and from 6.8 to 7.17.22.</p>
<div class="important admon">

<div class="admon_content">
<p>5.x indices are not compatible with 7.17.22. You must
remove or reindex them to upgrade to 7.17.22. The default Beats and
Logstash mapping templates also need to be updated to work with 7.17.22.</p>

<p>Logstash 6.8 and Beats 6.8 are compatible with all 7.x versions of

soon as possible to take advantage of performance improvements
and other enhancements.</p>
<p>The Java High Level REST Client can communicate with any Elasticsearch node running
the same major version and greater or equal minor version.
When you upgrade to the next major version, the client should be
updated <span class="strong strong"><strong>after</strong></span> all of the nodes in the cluster have been updated.</p>

<p>To upgrade directly to Elasticsearch 7.17.22 from versions 6.0-6.6, you must
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/reindex-upgrade.html" class="ulink" target="_top">manually reindex</a> any 5.x indices you need to
carry forward, and perform a <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/restart-upgrade.html" class="ulink" target="_top">full cluster restart</a>.
This includes any internal indices created in 5.x, such as the <code class="literal">.kibana</code> and
<code class="literal">.security*</code> indices.</p>
<p>Make sure all 5.x indices have been deleted before upgrading to 7.17.22. Elasticsearch
7.17.22 will fail to start if any 5.x indices are present.</p>
<p>If you are running a version prior to 6.0,
<a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack/6.8/upgrading-elastic-stack.html" class="ulink" target="_top">upgrade to 6.8</a>
and reindex your old indices or bring up a new 7.17.22 cluster and
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/reindex-upgrade-remote.html" class="ulink" target="_top">reindex from remote</a>.</p>
<p>The recommended path is to upgrade to 6.8 before upgrading to 7.17.22. This
makes it easier to identify the changes you need to make to upgrade and enables
you to perform a rolling upgrade with no downtime.</p>
<h3><a id="upgrade-elastic-stack-for-elastic-cloud"></a>Upgrading on Elastic Cloud<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.17/docs/en/install-upgrade/upgrading-stack.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>A single click in the Elastic Cloud console can upgrade a cluster to a newer
version, add more processing capacity, change plugins, and enable or disable
high availability, all at the same time. During the upgrade process,
Elasticsearch, Kibana, X-Pack and the officially included plugins are
upgraded simultaneously.</p>
<p>Although upgrading your Elastic Cloud clusters is easy, you still need to
address breaking changes that affect your application. Minor version upgrades,
upgrades from 6.8 to 7.17.22, and all other cluster configuration
changes can be performed with no downtime.</p>
<p>To avoid downtime when a full cluster restart is required:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Provision an additional cluster with the new Elasticsearch version, reindex
your data, and send index requests to both clusters temporarily.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Verify that the new cluster performs as expected, fix any problems, and then
permanently swap in the new cluster.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Delete the old cluster to stop incurring additional costs. You are billed
only for the time that the new cluster runs in parallel with your old cluster.
Usage is billed on an hourly basis.
</li>
</ol>
