<p>This list summarizes the most important enhancements in Observability 8.0.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h2><a id="_serverless_log_ingestion_from_amazon_s3_to_elastic"></a>Serverless log ingestion from Amazon S3 to Elastic</h2><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.0/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>We are delighted to announce the release of
<a href="/blog/elastic-and-aws-serverless-application-repository-speed-time-to-actionable-insights-with-frictionless-log-ingestion-from-amazon-s3" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic serverless forwarder</a>,
 a new Lambda application that helps users ingest logs from their Amazon Web
Services (AWS) environment into Elastic in a completely serverless fashion. AWS
users no longer have to set up and maintain compute resources for data ingestion,
 which simplifies the getting started experience and reduces data onboarding
 friction.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The elastic-serverless-forwarder application is publicly available in the AWS
Serverless Application repository (SAR), a managed repository for serverless
applications, for you to start using right away. Without leaving the AWS console,
 you can deploy the application from SAR, provide a few simple configuration
details, and get logs flowing from AWS to Elastic.</p>

<p>All Amazon Web Services (AWS) services provide an option to write their logs to
AWS CloudWatch logs. With Elastic already providing Amazon S3 input support, we
have now added Elastic Agent support for <a href="https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/aws/cloudwatch" class="ulink" target="_top">AWS CloudWatch</a>
 logs for all AWS integrations.</p>
<p>Users who aren’t using Amazon S3 to store their logs no longer have to set up
extra AWS infrastructure to send their logs to Elastic. This simplifies
ingestion architecture, reduces AWS operational costs, and removes any
onboarding friction. This new feature makes it even easier to integrate Elastic
services into AWS architecture and brings Elastic closer to the way you’re
currently working with Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p>Amazon S3 delivers cost-efficient and flexible storage, but optimizing the
utilization and cost-efficiency of ever-growing storage buckets across a large
organization can present challenges.</p>
<p>As AWS added the functionality for publishing Amazon S3 storage lens metrics to
CloudWatch, Elastic is proud to be an AWS launch partner to bring the
corresponding Elastic Agent integration to simplify bringing these metrics to Elastic.
DevOps and infrastructure teams can view, aggregate, and analyze <a href="https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/aws/s3_storage_lens" class="ulink" target="_top">AWS S3 Storage Lens</a>
metrics in Elastic alongside other application metrics, and use system logs to
make informed decisions about storage optimization.</p>

<p>Elastic Agent integrations are now available for <a href="https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/cassandra" class="ulink" target="_top">Cassandra (GA)</a>
 and <a href="https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/vsphere.html" class="ulink" target="_top">vSphere (beta)</a>,
making it easier to integrate these services with Elastic. The Elastic Agent-enabled
Cassandra integration fetches metrics from Cassandra using jolokia agent, can
parse System logs, and is now ready for production environments. The vSphere
integration (beta) provides Elastic Agent support for an important community-driven
server virtualization application.</p>

<div class="position-relative"><h2><a id="_apm_server_easier_to_manage_and_tune"></a>APM Server easier to manage and tune</h2><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.0/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>With a new implementation of the Elasticsearch output for APM Server now generally
available, out-of-the-box performance has been improved and ongoing
configuration tasks reduced. APM Server now uses a custom implementation
(rather than libbeat) that scales up without extra configuration and generally
requires less ongoing management of options.</p>
<p>If you’re using the <a href="https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/apm" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic APM integration</a>,
 you can now configure APM Server directly within Fleet. The new Elasticsearch
 output will also produce better out-of-the-box results without requiring manual
 configuration, and setup has been simplified and moved to Kibana.</p>
<p>We’ve also made a bunch of improvements to the APM app to bring the data
where you need it most and make it actionable, with clickable summaries on
services via the Service Map, an Errors view added to Services, and a new Traces
 app.</p>
<p>Click on any service in the Service Map app to get a summary of key metrics and
quick links to more details or map focus.</p>

<p>By integrating more details on Maven build steps into the APM distributed trace
visualization, you can now gain greater visibility into your Continuous
  Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) setup. These improvements provide
  visibility into build executions that publish artifacts or Docker images, or
  perform Snyk security checks, which increases your ability to troubleshoot and
   optimize build pipelines.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">

<p>Details are automatically captured on any Maven goal execution that produces a
Docker image. Remote systems like Docker registries and Maven artifact
repositories used to upload artifacts are not reported.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h2><a id="_better_alerting_views_and_management"></a>Better alerting views and management</h2><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.0/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>We’re pleased to release a number of enhancements that make it easier to view
and manage alerts. From within the Alerts app you can now easily view the rule
definition for an alert, and filter on active/recovered alerts. Any changes you
make to your Alerts app will now persist so you can finetune
your dashboard and navigate back and forward without losing your preferences.</p>

<div class="position-relative"><h2><a id="_easy_secure_connection_to_elasticsearch_from_elastic_agent_and_beats"></a>Easy secure connection to Elasticsearch from Elastic Agent and Beats</h2><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.0/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Elasticsearch now has security on by default in on-prem clusters, making it much easier
to set up a secure connection from Beats and Elastic Agent. Previously, you had to
use a separate tool to create SSL certificates, which added several steps to the
 setup process. If you don’t want to create your own, Elasticsearch can
 automatically generate them for you. It will display a fingerprint for the
 certificate authority in the console output. When you install Beats and Elastic Agent,
  you can pass this fingerprint to validate the certificate. This makes securing
   the connection to Elasticsearch as easy as copying and pasting a single string.</p>
<p>For example, when you’re setting up Fleet Server for the first time, Kibana
will show you a command to run to install the Elastic Agent. You can pass the
fingerprint to the installer like this:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">sudo ./elastic-agent install \
--fleet-server-es=https://localhost:9200 \  --fleet-server-service-token=AAEAAWVsYXN0aWMvZmxlZXQtc2VydmVyL3Rva2VuLTE2MzczMzUzMzU1Mzc6VDFTS1h5QkFSQkM5bWJPc1JlTlNhZw \
--fleet-server-policy=2d920850-494c-11ec-8478-9d8359796ea6 /
--fleet-server-es-ca-trusted-fingerprint 25c9d847ec0dc4a03228063662a6a944faf1a35fd0078de786ecd99b58b06ae5</pre>
</div>
<p>Fleet will automatically pass the SSL certificate information to Elastic Agents
enrolled in Fleet. We have similar fingerprint parameters for Elastic Agent running
in standalone mode and Beats. Please see the Integrations app in Kibana for
instructions or <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.0/configuring-stack-security.html#_connect_clients_to_elasticsearch_5" class="ulink" target="_top">see the documentation</a>.</p>
