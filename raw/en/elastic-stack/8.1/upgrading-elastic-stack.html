<p>To upgrade to 8.1.3 from 7.16 or earlier, <span class="strong strong"><strong>you must first upgrade to 7.17</strong></span>.
This enables you to use the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Upgrade Assistant</strong></span> to identify and resolve issues,
reindex indices created before 7.0, and then perform a rolling upgrade.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Upgrading to 7.17 before upgrading to 8.1.3 is required
even if you opt to do a full-cluster restart of your Elasticsearch cluster.</strong></span>
Alternatively, you can create a new 8.1.3 deployment and reindex from remote.
For more information, see <a class="xref" href="upgrade-elastic-stack-for-elastic-cloud.html#upgrading-reindex" title="Reindex to upgrade">Reindex to upgrade</a>.</p>
<p>Beats and Logstash 7.n are compatible with Elasticsearch 8.1.3
to give you flexibility in scheduling the upgrade.</p>

<div class="admon_content">
<h3>Remote cluster compatibility</h3>
<p>If you use cross-cluster search, note that 8.1.3 can only search remote clusters running the previous minor version or later.
For more information, see <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/modules-cross-cluster-search.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Searching across clusters</a>.</p>
<p>If you use cross-cluster replication, a cluster that contains follower indices must run the same or newer version as the remote cluster.
For more information, see <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/xpack-ccr.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Cross cluster replication</a> for version compatibility matrix.</p>
<p>You can view your remote clusters from <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management &gt; Remote Clusters</strong></span>.</p>

<p>As a temporary solution, you can submit requests to 8.x
using the 7.x syntax with the REST API compatibility mode.
While this enables you to submit requests that use the old syntax,
it does not guarantee the same behavior.
REST API compatibility should be a bridge to smooth out the upgrade process,
not a long term strategy.
