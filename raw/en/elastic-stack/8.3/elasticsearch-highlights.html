<p>This list summarizes the most important enhancements in Elasticsearch 8.3.
For the complete list, go to <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.3/release-highlights.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch release highlights</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="ingest_performance_improvement"></a><a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/84250" class="ulink" target="_top">Ingest performance improvement</a><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.3/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>We have improved the pipeline execution logic for pipelines with processors that are synchronous
by avoiding (deep) recursion.
On our nightly benchmark that simulates a Logging use-case, this resulted in a 10% reduction of
CPU time spent on ingest pipelines and a 3% overall ingestion speedup.</p>
<h4><a id="execute_self_reference_checks_once_per_pipeline"></a><a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/85926" class="ulink" target="_top">Execute self-reference checks once per pipeline</a><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.3/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Ingest pipelines have a mechanism to prevent circular references in the records
they process, so that they are serializable. Prior to this change, this check was
performed after each <code class="literal">script</code> processor execution, and was ignorable.</p>
<p>Because of this check, a script processor configured with</p>
<pre class="screen">"source": """
    def x = ctx;
    ctx.x = x;
"""</pre>
<p>&#8230;&#8203;would error with <code class="literal">"type" : "illegal_argument_exception", "reason" : "Iterable
object is self-referencing itself (ingest script)"</code>.</p>
<p>If the script processor also had</p>
<pre class="screen">"ignore_failure" true</pre>
<p>&#8230;&#8203;then the handling thread would actually crash from an unrecoverable
StackOverflowError when trying to serialize the resulting event.</p>
<p>Now, this check is performed once per pipeline, remediating the potential for
a StackOverflowError. There are some side effects also:</p>

There is a slight speed up for pipelines with multiple scripts, and a slight
slowdown for pipelines without scripts.

<h4><a id="question_answering_nlp_task"></a><a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/85958" class="ulink" target="_top">Question answering NLP task</a><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.3/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>We introduce a new question answering NLP task in 8.3. This task extracts
the relevant section that answers a specific question from a larger context.
This is especially suited to search requests against large documents. You
can see an example of extracting an answer from a larger wiki article about
Tower Bridge below.</p>

<h4><a id="add_support_for_dots_in_field_names_for_metrics_usecases"></a><a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/86166" class="ulink" target="_top">Add support for dots in field names for metrics usecases</a><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.3/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Metrics data can often be made of several fields with dots in their names,
sharing common prefixes, like in the following example:</p>
<pre class="screen">{
  "metrics.time" : 10,
  "metrics.time.min" : 1,
  "metrics.time.max" : 500
}</pre>
<p>Such format causes a mapping conflict as the <code class="literal">metrics.time</code> holds a value,
but it also needs to be mapped as an object in order to hold the <code class="literal">min</code> and
<code class="literal">max</code> leaf fields.</p>
<p>A new object mapping parameter called <code class="literal">subobjects</code>, which defaults to <code class="literal">true</code>,
has been introduced to preserve dots in field names. An object with <code class="literal">subobjects</code>
set to <code class="literal">false</code> can only ever hold leaf sub-fields and no further objects. The
following example shows how it can be configured in the mappings for the
<code class="literal">metrics</code> object:</p>
<pre class="screen">{
  "mappings": {
    "properties" : {
      "metrics" : {
        "type" : "object",
        "subobjects" : false
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>With this configuration any child of <code class="literal">metrics</code> will be mapped unchanged,
without expanding dots in field names to the corresponding object structure.
That makes it possible to store the metrics document above.</p>
<h4><a id="reading_indices_from_older_elasticsearch_versions"></a><a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/86261" class="ulink" target="_top">Reading indices from older Elasticsearch versions</a><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.3/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Elasticsearch has full query and write support for indices created in the previous major
version. If you have indices created in Elasticsearch versions 5 or 6, you can now use
the archive functionality to import and query these indices as well.
The archive functionality provides slower read-only access to older data,
for compliance or regulatory reasons, the occasional lookback or investigation,
or to rehydrate parts of it. Access to the data is expected to be infrequent,
and can therefore happen with limited performance and query capabilities.</p>
<h4><a id="transforms_support_range_aggregation"></a><a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/86501" class="ulink" target="_top">Transforms support range aggregation</a><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.3/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Now it is possible to use the range aggregations in transforms.
Transforms didn’t support multi-bucket aggregations, but this
limitation no longer exists.</p>
<h4><a id="new_geo_grid_query"></a><a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/86596" class="ulink" target="_top">New geo_grid query</a><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.3/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>With the geo grid query, you can now natively return all the documents that overlap a specific geo tile.
There is no need to reconstruct the geometry or the actual boundaries of the spatial cluster as Elasticsearch
can do this for you, which saves you time and reduces complexity.
This is especially useful when geometries are spread across tiles like on a soccer ball or football.
While hexagon tiles line the sphere, calculating the boundary of each tile is not straightforward.</p>
<pre class="screen">GET /example/_search
{
  "query": {
    "geo_grid" :{
      "location" : {
        "geotile" : "6/32/22"
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>Geo grid query can also help determine the single source of truth of containment.
With geo grid query, you can match exactly the intersection-test of Elasticsearch.
As an example, if a client has bounds for a grid-cell at a higher (or lower) precision than what is used
by Elasticsearch when running a corresponding aggregation, the containment-check might be slightly different.
This side-steps any disconnect based on projection/datum difference between client and Elasticsearch.</p>
