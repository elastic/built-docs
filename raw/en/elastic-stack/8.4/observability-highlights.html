<p>This list summarizes the most important enhancements in Observability 8.4.</p>
<h2><a id="_new_synthetics_app_enhancements_for_public_beta"></a>New Synthetics App enhancements for public beta<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.4/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>As we progress towards delivering an all new Synthetic Monitoring capability
within Elastic Observability, we’re excited to announce two big new enhancements
for our 8.4 stack release:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Private testing locations
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Open access to the managed testing service for all Elastic Cloud users
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>With private testing locations you can now configure a testing location on
self-managed infrastructure. This means you can test applications that
aren’t publicly available on the internet or from locations where Elastic may not
yet have a managed testing node presence.</p>
<p>A big part of our new Synthetics app is the ability to run synthetic monitoring
tests on our new global network of managed testing locations. With the 8.4
release, we’ll no longer be requiring users to request access. To
use our managed testing infrastructure, open the Uptime app and click
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Monitor Management</strong></span>. There is a fair usage cap in place but all test executions
are free. We’d love to get you involved and <a href="https://discuss.elastic.co/c/observability/82" class="ulink" target="_top">get your feedback</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="_observability_alerting_and_rules_views_now_generally_available_ga"></a>Observability alerting and rules views now generally available (GA)<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.4/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>Alerting and rule management for Observability-specific alerts and rules have
been offered as a technical preview since 7.16. We have made significant
improvements since then and we now have robust, feature-rich
capabilities that are production ready.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">

</div>
<p>Working alongside Cases functionality for incident management, Observability
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Alerts</strong></span> and <span class="strong strong"><strong>Rules</strong></span> views provide an easy way to access and manage
Observability-specific rules, alerts, and cases within the Observability UI.
With comprehensive filtering and search support, you can quickly view or edit
alerts or rules of interest.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/observability-rules.png" alt="Observability Rules view">
</div>
</div>
<p>The rule details page offers rule creators and
administrators a complete history of rule executions and seamless access to
generated alerts for effective management. In 8.4 the rule details page has been
further enhanced to include an at-a-glance alert summary that shows the status
and timeline for triggered alerts, along with a number of other UI improvements,
including bulk action support.</p>

<p>With two new <em>Top 5</em> views introduced for version 8.4, you can quickly identify
the impact of application errors and reduce time spent identifying and tracking
errors.</p>
<p>The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Top 5 errors</strong></span> view is available from the APM Transaction details page:</p>

<p>Bringing together metric and trace data provides powerful insights to help you
understand application performance and identify the source of any issues.
Available as a beta feature in 8.4, Infrastructure metrics for containers, pods,
and hosts are available in the context of individual services. You can use the new
Infrastructure tab in the APM Service Overview to get a summary view of the
infrastructure supporting a service, and drill down into metrics
for additional details.</p>

<p>With Elastic APM already natively supporting the OpenTelemetry protocol,
instrumentation instructions have been added to Elastic APM agent onboarding to
simplify and streamline the use of OpenTelemetry agents with Elastic APM.</p>

<div class="content">

</div>
<p>In addition, APM Server has now added support for ingestion of OpenTelemetry
summary metrics (sum and count), including those created by Prometheus exporters.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/apm/guide/8.4/open-telemetry.html" class="ulink" target="_top">OpenTelemetry documentation</a></p>
<h2><a id="_custom_ingest_pipeline_support_for_apm_integration"></a>Custom ingest pipeline support for APM integration<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.4/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>The Elastic APM integration now supports custom ingest pipelines. A custom
pipeline allows you to transform data to better match your specific use case.
This can be useful, for example, to ensure data security by removing or
obfuscating sensitive information.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/apm/guide/8.4/ingest-pipelines.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Ingest pipelines documentation</a></p>

<p>With Elastic Observability 8.4, ITOps and SRE teams can leverage out-of-the-box
Kubernetes dashboards for cluster-level visibility into essential Kubernetes
components (nodes, pods, deployments, etc.). Notable features include:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Highly customizable dashboards – you can use Kibana Lens to update or remove
panels, or create new panels using the smart suggestion capability

<p>Take advantage of the new IIS integration which makes it easier than ever to
monitor and visualize IIS and .NET metrics in the context of web services
running on IIS, including alerting for user experience issues.</p>
<p>This new integration provides deep visibility into each web server process group
and helps correlate host and NW metrics with web server-specific metrics for
better fault identification and isolation.</p>

<p>The new vSphere integration enables optimal splitting and performance allocation
between VMs. You can now reduce time to detect problems and pinpoint the root
cause in your virtualization and application layer by discovering how your
virtualized configuration impacts your app servers and end user experience.</p>
