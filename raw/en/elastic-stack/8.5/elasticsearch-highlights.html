<p>This list summarizes the most important enhancements in Elasticsearch 8.5.
For the complete list, go to <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.5/release-highlights.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch release highlights</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="speed_up_sql_queries_by_not_tracking_total_hits_by_default"></a>Speed up SQL queries by not tracking total hits by default<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.5/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>SQL query translator now explicitly sets track_total_hits to false when
not needed.
This has a significant impact on SQL query performance in cases where total hits
are not needed to calculate the final result, in particular when the cost of evaluation
of a single document is particularly high (eg. queries that involve script evaluation)
and in queries with a small LIMIT value.
In our tests, on some specific queries, we see a speed-up of more than 50%,
with peaks of ~95% (from 600ms to 20ms).</p>

<h4><a id="ilm_no_longer_rolls_over_empty_indices"></a>ILM no longer rolls over empty indices<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.5/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>For both new and existing Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) policies,
the rollover action will only execute if an index has at least one document.</p>
<p>For indices with a <code class="literal">max_age</code> condition that are no longer being written
to, this will mean that they will no longer roll over every time their
<code class="literal">max_age</code> is reached.</p>
<p>A policy can override this behavior, and explicitly opt in to rolling over
empty indices, by adding a <code class="literal">"min_docs": 0</code> condition:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT _ilm/policy/allow_empty_rollover_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "actions": {
          "rollover" : {
            "max_age": "7d",
            "max_size": "100gb",
            "min_docs": 0
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/11.console"></div>
<p>This can also be disabled on a cluster-wide basis by setting
<code class="literal">indices.lifecycle.rollover.only_if_has_documents</code> to <code class="literal">false</code>.</p>

<h4><a id="release_time_series_data_stream_tsds_functionality"></a>Release time series data stream (TSDS) functionality<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.5/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Elasticsearch offers support for time series data stream (TSDS) indices.
A TSDS index is an index that contains time series metrics data as part
of a data stream. Elasticsearch routes the incoming documents into a TSDS
index so that all the documents for a particular time series are on the
same shard, and then sorts the shard by time series and timestamp. This
structure has a few advantages:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Documents from the same time series are next to each other on the shard, and
hence stored next to each other on the disk, so the operating system pages are
much more homogeneous and compress better, yielding massive reduction in TCO.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The analysis of a time series typically involves comparing each two consecutive
docs (samples), examining the last doc in a given time window, etc., which is quite
complex when the next doc could be on any shard, and in fact on any index. Sorting
by time series and timestamp allows improved analysis, both in terms of performance
and in terms of our ability to add new aggregations.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Finally,  as part of the Index Lifecycle Management of metrics data time series,
Elasticsearch enables a Downsampling action. When an index is downsampled,
Elasticsearch keeps a single document with statistical summaries per each bucket
of time in the time series. Supported aggregations can then be run on the data
stream and include both downsampled indices and raw data indices, without the
user needing to be aware of that. Downsampling of downsampled indices, to more
coarse time resolution, is also supported.</p>

<h4><a id="unattended_mode_for_transforms"></a>Unattended mode for transforms<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.5/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The new <code class="literal">unattended</code> setting for transforms introduces unattended mode. It
enables the transform to retry indefinitely, even in the face of errors that
require direct intervention to resolve. For example, a high disk watermark may
prevent all ingest activities, including the indexing operation of a transform;
however once the original issue is resolved by the system administrator, the
transform automatically continues to operate from where it stopped working.
Neither the system administrator nor the end-user need to restart the transform.</p>

<h4><a id="frequent-items-agg"></a>Frequent items aggregation<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.5/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.5/search-aggregations-bucket-frequent-items-aggregation.html" class="ulink" target="_top">frequent items aggregation</a>
is a new bucket aggregation which identifies items that often occur together. It
is a form of association rule mining that helps to discover relationships
between different data points. For example, the aggregation can find attributes
of log events that tend to co-occur and may give a more informative explanation
for the possible causes of a spike in the logs.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/83055" class="ulink" target="_top">#83055</a></p>
<h4><a id="more-efficient-snapshots"></a>More efficient snapshots<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.5/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The overhead of the snapshot operation has been reduced significantly. Snapshots
now run in a more efficient order and require much less network traffic than
before.</p>
