<p>This topic applies only to customers running the Elastic Stack on Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) or Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Elastic provides customers with two major self-managed orchestrators to manage the Elastic Stack. Before you can upgrade the products in the stack, you need to ensure your orchestrator is running a compatible version. If it&#8217;s incompatible, you&#8217;ll need to upgrade the orchestrator first before you can upgrade the stack.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="_upgrade_ece"></a>Upgrade ECE</h3><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/9.0/docs/en/install-upgrade/upgrade-orchestrator.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) provides an easy way to provision, manage, and scale a fleet of Elasticsearch deployments from a central place. It can be installed on a public cloud platform, such as AWS, GCP or Microsoft Azure, on your own private cloud, or on bare metal.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to upgrade to 9.0.0-rc1, the minimum required version is ECE 3.0.0. If you&#8217;re running an earlier version, refer to <a href="/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/ece-upgrade.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrade your installation</a> for instructions on how to upgrade.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="_upgrade_eck"></a>Upgrade ECK</h3><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/9.0/docs/en/install-upgrade/upgrade-orchestrator.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) is built on the Kubernetes operator pattern and extends the basic Kubernetes orchestration capabilities to support the setup and management of Elastic products and solutions on Kubernetes.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re planning to upgrade to 9.0.0-rc1, refer to the list of <a href="/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-supported.html" class="ulink" target="_top">supported versions</a> to ensure your current ECK version is compatible. If it isn&#8217;t, refer to <a href="/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-upgrading-eck.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrade ECK</a> for instructions on how to upgrade.</p>
