<p>Curator was written in Python, which allows it to be distributed as code which
can run across a wide variety of systems, including Linux, Windows, Mac OS, and
any other system or architecture for which a Python interpreter has been
written. Curator was also written to be usable by the 4 most recent major
release branches of Python: 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.  It may even run on other
versions, but those versions are not tested.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this broad support comes at a cost.  While Curator happily ran
on Python version 2.6, this version had its last update more than 3 years ago.
There have been many improvements to security, SSL/TLS and the libraries that
support them since then.  Not all of these have been back-ported, which results
in Curator not being able to communicate securely via SSL/TLS, or in some cases
even connect securely.</p>
<p>Because it is impossible to know if a given system has the correct Python
version, leave alone the most recent libraries and modules, it becomes nearly
impossible to guarantee that Curator will be able to make a secure and
error-free connection to a secured Elasticsearch instance for any <code class="literal">pip</code> or
RPM/DEB installed modules.  This has lead to an increased amount of
troubleshooting and support work for Curator.  The precompiled binary packages
were created to address this.</p>
<p>The precompiled binary packages (APT/YUM, Windows) have been compiled with
Python 3.6.3, which has all of the up-to-date libraries needed for secure
transactions.  These packages have been tested connecting to Security (5.x
X-Pack) with self-signed PKI certificates.  Connectivity via SSL or TLS to other
open-source plugins may work, but is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>If you are encountering SSL/TLS errors in Curator, please see the list of
