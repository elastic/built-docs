<h4><a id="_tldr_no_curator_can_only_delete_entire_indices"></a>TL;DR: No. Curator can only delete entire indices.<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/curator/edit/5.x/docs/asciidoc/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<h4><a id="_full_answer"></a>Full answer:<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/curator/edit/5.x/docs/asciidoc/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>As a thought exercise, think of Elasticsearch indices as being like databases,
or tablespaces within a database. If you had hundreds of millions of rows to
delete from your database, would you run a separate
<code class="literal">DELETE from TABLE where date&lt;YYYY.MM.dd</code> to assemble hundreds of millions of
individual delete operations every day, or would you partition your tables in a
way that you could simply run <code class="literal">DROP table TABLENAME.YYYY.MM.dd</code>? The strain on
your database would be astronomical on the former and next to nothing on the
latter. Elasticsearch works much the same way. While Elasticsearch <em>can</em>
technically do both methods, for use-cases with time-series data (like logging),
we recommend dropping entire indices vs. the extremely I/O expensive search and
delete method. Curator was created to help fill that need.</p>
<p>While you can store different types within different indices (e.g.
syslog-2014.05.05, apache-2015.05.06), this gets very expensive, very quickly in
a totally different way. Each shard in Elasticsearch is a Lucene index. Each
index requires a portion of the heap to exist and be kept current. If you have 3
daily indices with 5 primary shards each, you suddenly have reduced the
available heap space for shard management by a factor of 3, having gone from 5
shards to 15, <em>per index,</em> not counting multiple indexes per day. The ways to
mitigate this (if you pursue this route) include massive daily indexing boxes
and using shard allocation/routing to move indices to specific members of the
cluster where they can have less effect; keeping fewer days of information;
having more nodes in your cluster, and so forth.</p>

<p>While it may be desirable to have different life-cycles for your data, sometimes
it&#8217;s just easier and cheaper to store everything as long as the longest
life-cycle you wish to maintain.</p>

<p>Even though it is neither recommended <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>,
nor best practices, it is still possible to perform these search &amp; delete
operations yourself, using the <a href="http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/docs-delete-by-query.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Delete-by-Query
API</a>. Curator will not be modified to perform operations such as these, however.
Curator is meant to manage at the index level, rather than the data level.</p>

<sup>[<a href="#_footnoteref_1">1</a>]</sup> There are reasons Elasticsearch does not recommend this, particularly for time-series data.
