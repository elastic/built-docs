<p>Curator was first called
<a href="https://logstash.jira.com/browse/LOGSTASH-211" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">clearESindices.py</code></a>.  Its sole
function was to delete indices. It was almost immediately renamed to
<a href="https://logstash.jira.com/browse/LOGSTASH-211" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">logstash_index_cleaner.py</code></a>.
After a time it was briefly relocated under the
<a href="https://github.com/elastic/logstash" class="ulink" target="_top">logstash</a> repository as
<code class="literal">expire_logs</code>, at which point it began to gain new functionality.  Soon
thereafter, Jordan Sissel was hired by Elastic (then still Elasticsearch), as
was the original author of Curator.  Not long after that it became Elasticsearch
Curator and is now hosted at <a href="https://github.com/elastic/curator" class="ulink" target="_top">https://github.com/elastic/curator</a></p>
<p>Curator now performs many operations on your Elasticsearch indices, from delete
to snapshot to shard allocation routing.</p>
