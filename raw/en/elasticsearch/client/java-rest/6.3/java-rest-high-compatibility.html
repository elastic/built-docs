<p>The Java High Level REST Client requires Java 1.8 and depends on the Elasticsearch
core project. The client version is the same as the Elasticsearch version that the
client was developed for. It accepts the same request arguments as the <code class="literal">TransportClient</code>
and returns the same response objects. See the <a class="xref" href="java-rest-high-level-migration.html" title="Migration Guide"><em>Migration Guide</em></a>
if you need to migrate an application from <code class="literal">TransportClient</code> to the new REST client.</p>
<p>The High Level Client is guaranteed to be able to communicate with any Elasticsearch
node running on the same major version and greater or equal minor version. It
doesn&#8217;t need to be in the same minor version as the Elasticsearch nodes it
communicates with, as it is forward compatible meaning that it supports
communicating with later versions of Elasticsearch than the one it was developed for.</p>
<p>The 6.0 client is able to communicate with any 6.x Elasticsearch node, while the 6.1
client is for sure able to communicate with 6.1, 6.2 and any later 6.x version, but
there may be incompatibility issues when communicating with a previous Elasticsearch
node version, for instance between 6.1 and 6.0, in case the 6.1 client supports new
request body fields for some APIs that are not known by the 6.0 node(s).</p>
<p>It is recommended to upgrade the High Level Client when upgrading the Elasticsearch
cluster to a new major version, as REST API breaking changes may cause unexpected
results depending on the node that is hit by the request, and newly added APIs will
only be supported by the newer version of the client. The client should always be
updated last, once all of the nodes in the cluster have been upgraded to the new
major version.</p>
