<p>Testing is one of the most important parts of developing an application.
The client is very flexible when it comes to testing and is compatible with
most testing frameworks (such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ava" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">ava</code></a>,
which is used in the examples below).</p>
<p>If you are using this client, you are most likely working with Elasticsearch, and one of
the first issues you face is how to test your application. A perfectly valid
solution is to use the real Elasticsearch instance for testing your application, but you
would be doing an integration test, while you want a unit test. There are many
ways to solve this problem, you could create the database with Docker, or use an
in-memory compatible one, but if you are writing unit tests that can be easily
parallelized this becomes quite uncomfortable. A different way of improving your
testing experience while doing unit tests is to use a mock.</p>
<p>The client is designed to be easy to extend and adapt to your needs. Thanks to
its internal architecture it allows you to change some specific components while
keeping the rest of it working as usual. Each Elasticsearch official client is composed
of the following components:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">API layer</code>: every Elasticsearch API that you can call.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">Transport</code>: a component that takes care of preparing a request before sending
it and handling all the retry and sniffing strategies.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">ConnectionPool</code>: Elasticsearch is a cluster and might have multiple nodes, the
<code class="literal">ConnectionPool</code> takes care of them.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">Serializer</code>: A class with all the serialization strategies, from the basic
JSON to the new line delimited JSON.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">Connection</code>: The actual HTTP library.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The best way to mock Elasticsearch with the official clients is to replace the
<code class="literal">Connection</code> component since it has very few responsibilities and it does not
interact with other internal components other than getting requests and
returning responses.</p>

<p>Writing each time a mock for your test can be annoying and error-prone, so we
have built a simple yet powerful mocking library specifically designed for this
client, and you can install it with the following command:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sh">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sh">npm install @elastic/elasticsearch-mock --save-dev</pre>
</div>
<p>With this library you can create custom mocks for any request you can send to
Elasticsearch. It offers a simple and intuitive API and it mocks only the HTTP layer,
leaving the rest of the client working as usual.</p>
<p>Before showing all of its features, and what you can do with it, let’s see an
example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">const { Client } = require('@elastic/elasticsearch')
const Mock = require('@elastic/elasticsearch-mock')

const mock = new Mock()
const client = new Client({
  node: 'http://localhost:9200',
  Connection: mock.getConnection()
})

mock.add({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/'
}, () =&gt; {
  return { status: 'ok' }
})

client.info(console.log)</pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see it works closely with the client itself, once you have created a
new instance of the mock library you just need to call the mock.getConnection()
method and pass its result to the Connection option of the client. From now on,
every request is handled by the mock library,  and the HTTP layer will never be
touched. As a result, your test is significantly faster and you are able to
easily parallelize them!</p>
<p>The library allows you to write both “strict” and “loose” mocks, which means
that you can write a mock that handles a very specific request or be looser and
handle a group of request, let’s see this in action:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">mock.add({
  method: 'POST',
  path: '/indexName/_search'
}, () =&gt; {
  return {
    hits: {
      total: { value: 1, relation: 'eq' },
      hits: [{ _source: { baz: 'faz' } }]
    }
  }
})

mock.add({
  method: 'POST',
  path: '/indexName/_search',
  body: { query: { match: { foo: 'bar' } } }
}, () =&gt; {
  return {
    hits: {
      total: { value: 0, relation: 'eq' },
      hits: []
    }
  }
})</pre>
</div>
<p>In the example above, every search request gets the first response, while every
search request that uses the query described in the second mock gets the second
response.</p>
<p>You can also specify dynamic paths:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">mock.add({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/:index/_count'
}, () =&gt; {
  return { count: 42 }
})

client.count({ index: 'foo' }, console.log) // =&gt; { count: 42 }
client.count({ index: 'bar' }, console.log) // =&gt; { count: 42 }</pre>
</div>
<p>And wildcards are supported as well.</p>
<p>Another very interesting use case is the ability to create a test that randomly
fails to see how your code reacts to failures:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">mock.add({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/:index/_count'
}, () =&gt; {
  if (Math.random() &gt; 0.8) {
    return ResponseError({ body: {}, statusCode: 500 })
  } else {
    return { count: 42 }
  }
})</pre>
</div>
<p>We have seen how simple is mocking Elasticsearch and testing your application, you can
find many more features and examples in the
<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-js-mock" class="ulink" target="_top">module documentation</a>.</p>
