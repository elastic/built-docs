<p>This page contains the information you need to create an instance of the .NET
Client for Elasticsearch that connects to your Elasticsearch cluster.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to connect to your Elasticsearch cluster via a single node, or by
specifying multiple nodes using a node pool. Using a node pool has a few
advantages over a single node, such as load balancing and cluster failover
support. The client provides convenient configuration options to connect to an
Elastic Cloud deployment.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Client applications should create a single instance of
<code class="literal">ElasticsearchClient</code> that is used throughout your application for its entire
lifetime. Internally the client manages and maintains HTTP connections to nodes,
reusing them to optimize performance. If you use a dependency injection
container for your application, the client instance should be registered with a
singleton lifetime.</p>

<h3><a id="cloud-deployment"></a>Connecting to a cloud deployment<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.0/docs/connecting.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><a href="/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-getting-started.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Cloud</a>
is the easiest way to get started with Elasticsearch. When connecting to Elastic Cloud
with the .NET Elasticsearch client you should always use the Cloud ID. You can find this
value within the "Manage Deployment" page after you&#8217;ve created a cluster
(look in the top-left if you&#8217;re in Kibana).</p>
<p>We recommend using a Cloud ID whenever possible because your client will be
automatically configured for optimal use with Elastic Cloud, including HTTPS and
HTTP compression.</p>
<p>Connecting to an Elasticsearch Service deployment is achieved by providing the
unique Cloud ID for your deployment when configuring the <code class="literal">ElasticsearchClient</code>
instance. You also require suitable credentials, either a username and password or
an API key that your application uses to authenticate with your deployment.</p>
<p>As a security best practice, it is recommended to create a dedicated API key per
application, with permissions limited to only those required for any API calls
the application is authorized to make.</p>
<p>The following snippet demonstrates how to create a client instance that connects to
an Elasticsearch deployment in the cloud.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-csharp">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-csharp">using Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch;
using Elastic.Transport;

var client = new ElasticsearchClient("&lt;CLOUD_ID&gt;", new ApiKey("&lt;API_KEY&gt;")); <a id="CO1-1"></a><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i></pre>

<h3><a id="single-node"></a>Connecting to a single node<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.0/docs/connecting.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Single node configuration is best suited to connections to a multi-node cluster
running behind a load balancer or reverse proxy, which is exposed via a single
URL. It may also be convenient to use a single node during local application
development. If the URL represents a single Elasticsearch node, be aware that this offers
no resiliency should the server be unreachable or unresponsive.</p>
<p>By default, security features such as authentication and TLS are enabled on Elasticsearch
clusters. When you start Elasticsearch for the first time, TLS is configured
automatically for the HTTP layer. A CA certificate is generated and stored on
disk which is used to sign the certificates for the HTTP layer of the Elasticsearch
cluster.</p>
<p>In order for the client to establish a connection with the cluster over HTTPS,
the CA certificate must be trusted by the client application. The simplest
choice is to use the hex-encoded SHA-256 fingerprint of the CA certificate. The
CA fingerprint is output to the terminal when you start Elasticsearch for the first time.
You&#8217;ll see a distinct block like the one below in the output from Elasticsearch (you may
have to scroll up if it&#8217;s been a while):</p>

<p>Note down the <code class="literal">elastic</code> user password and HTTP CA fingerprint for the next

<p>The CA fingerprint can also be retrieved at any time from a running cluster using
the following command:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256 -in config/certs/http_ca.crt</pre>
</div>
<p>The command returns the security certificate, including the fingerprint. The
<code class="literal">issuer</code> should be <code class="literal">Elasticsearch security auto-configuration HTTP CA</code>.</p>

<p>The following snippet shows you how to create a client instance that connects to
your Elasticsearch cluster via a single node, using the CA fingerprint:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-csharp">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-csharp">using Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch;
using Elastic.Transport;

var settings = new ElasticsearchClientSettings(new Uri("https://localhost:9200"))
    .CertificateFingerprint("&lt;FINGERPRINT&gt;")
    .Authentication(new BasicAuthentication("&lt;USERNAME&gt;", "&lt;PASSWORD&gt;"));

var client = new ElasticsearchClient(settings);</pre>
</div>
<p>The preceding snippet demonstrates configuring the client to authenticate by
providing a username and password with basic authentication. If preferred, you
may also use <code class="literal">ApiKey</code> authentication as shown in the cloud connection example.</p>
<h3><a id="multiple-nodes"></a>Connecting to multiple nodes using a node pool<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/8.0/docs/connecting.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>To provide resiliency, you should configure multiple nodes for your cluster to
which the client attempts to communicate. By default, the client cycles through
nodes for each request in a round robin fashion. The client also tracks
unhealthy nodes and avoids sending requests to them until they become healthy.</p>
<p>This configuration is best suited to connect to a known small sized cluster,
where you do not require sniffing to detect the cluster topology.</p>
<p>The following snippet shows you how to connect to multiple nodes by using a
static node pool:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-csharp">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-csharp">using Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch;
using Elastic.Transport;

var nodes = new Uri[]
{
	new Uri("https://myserver1:9200"),
	new Uri("https://myserver2:9200"),
	new Uri("https://myserver3:9200")
};

var pool = new StaticNodePool(nodes);

var settings = new ElasticsearchClientSettings(pool)
    .CertificateFingerprint("&lt;FINGERPRINT&gt;")
    .Authentication(new ApiKey("&lt;API_KEY&gt;"));

var client = new ElasticsearchClient(settings);</pre>
