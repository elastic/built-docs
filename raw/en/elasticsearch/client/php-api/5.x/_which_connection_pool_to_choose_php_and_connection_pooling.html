<p>At first glance, the <code class="literal">sniffingConnectionPool</code> implementation seems superior.  For many languages, it is.  In PHP, the
conversation is a bit more nuanced.</p>
<p>Because PHP is a share-nothing architecture, there is no way to maintain a connection pool across script instances.
This means that every script is responsible for creating, maintaining, and destroying connections everytime the script
is re-run.</p>
<p>Sniffing is a relatively lightweight operation (one API call to <code class="literal">/_cluster/state</code>, followed by pings to each node) but
it may be a non-negligible overhead for certain PHP applications.  The average PHP script will likely load the client,
execute a few queries and then close.  Imagine this script being called 1000 times per second: the sniffing connection
pool will perform the sniffing and pinging process 1000 times per second.  The sniffing process will add a large
amount of overhead.</p>
<p>In reality, if your script only executes a few queries, the sniffing concept is <em>too</em> robust.  It tends to be more
useful in long-lived processes which potentially "out-live" a static list.</p>
<p>For this reason the default connection pool is currently the <code class="literal">staticNoPingConnectionPool</code>.  You can, of course, change
this default - but we strongly recommend you load test and verify that it does not negatively impact your performance.</p>
