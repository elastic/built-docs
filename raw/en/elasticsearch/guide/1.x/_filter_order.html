<p>The order of filters in a <code class="literal">bool</code> clause is important for performance. More-specific filters should be placed before less-specific filters in order to
exclude as many documents as possible, as early as possible.</p>
<p>If Clause A could match 10 million documents, and Clause B could match
only 100 documents, then Clause B should be placed before Clause A.</p>
<p>Cached filters are very fast, so they should be placed before filters that
are not cacheable.  Imagine that we have an index that contains one month&#8217;s
worth of log events. However, we&#8217;re mostly interested only in log events from
the previous hour:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">GET /logs/2014-01/_search
{
    "query" : {
        "filtered" : {
            "filter" : {
                "range" : {
                    "timestamp" : {
                        "gt" : "now-1h"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>This filter is not cached because it uses the <code class="literal">now</code> function, the value of
which changes every millisecond. That means that we have to examine one
month&#8217;s worth of log events every time we run this query!</p>
<p>We could make this much more efficient by combining it with a cached filter:
we can exclude most of the month&#8217;s data by adding a filter that uses a fixed
point in time, such as midnight last night:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">"bool": {
    "must": [
        { "range" : {
            "timestamp" : {
                "gt" : "now-1h/d" <a id="CO56-1"></a><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i>
            }
        }},
        { "range" : {
            "timestamp" : {
                "gt" : "now-1h" <a id="CO56-2"></a><i class="conum" data-value="2"></i>
            }
        }}
    ]
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="calloutlist">
<table border="0" summary="Callout list">
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO56-1"><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i></a></p>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>This filter is cached because it uses <code class="literal">now</code> rounded to midnight.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO56-2"><i class="conum" data-value="2"></i></a></p>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>This filter is not cached because it uses <code class="literal">now</code> <em>without</em> rounding.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>The <code class="literal">now-1h/d</code> clause rounds to the previous midnight and so excludes all documents
created before today.  The resulting bitset is cached because <code class="literal">now</code> is used
with rounding, which means that it is executed only once a day, when the value
for <em>midnight-last-night</em> changes.  The <code class="literal">now-1h</code> clause isn&#8217;t cached because
<code class="literal">now</code> produces a time accurate to the nearest millisecond. However, thanks to
the first filter, this second filter need only check documents that have been
created since midnight.</p>
<p>The order of these clauses is important. This approach works only because the
<em>since-midnight</em> clause comes before the <em>last-hour</em> clause. If they were the
other  way around, then the <em>last-hour</em> clause would need to examine all
documents in the index, instead of just documents created since midnight.</p>
