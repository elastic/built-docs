<p>This book is divided into seven parts:</p>

<li class="listitem">
Chapters <a class="xref" href="intro.html" title="You Know, for Search&#8230;&#8203;"><em>You Know, for Search&#8230;&#8203;</em></a> through <a class="xref" href="inside-a-shard.html" title="Inside a Shard"><em>Inside a Shard</em></a> provide an introduction to Elasticsearch. They
explain how to get your data in and out of Elasticsearch, how Elasticsearch
interprets the data in your documents, how basic search works, and how to
manage indices. By the end of this section, you will already be able to
integrate your application with Elasticsearch. Chapters
<a class="xref" href="distributed-cluster.html" title="Life Inside a Cluster"><em>Life Inside a Cluster</em></a>, <a class="xref" href="distributed-docs.html" title="Distributed Document Store"><em>Distributed Document Store</em></a>, <a class="xref" href="distributed-search.html" title="Distributed Search Execution"><em>Distributed Search Execution</em></a>, and <a class="xref" href="inside-a-shard.html" title="Inside a Shard"><em>Inside a Shard</em></a>
are supplemental chapters that provide more insight into the distributed
processes at work, but are not required reading.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Chapters <a class="xref" href="structured-search.html" title="Structured Search"><em>Structured Search</em></a> through <a class="xref" href="controlling-relevance.html" title="Controlling Relevance"><em>Controlling Relevance</em></a>
offer a deep dive into search&#8212;&#8203;how to index and
query your data to allow  you to take advantage of more-advanced concepts
such as word proximity, and partial matching. You will understand how
relevance works and how to control it to ensure that the best results are
on the first page.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Chapters <a class="xref" href="language-intro.html" title="Getting Started with Languages"><em>Getting Started with Languages</em></a> through <a class="xref" href="fuzzy-matching.html" title="Typoes and Mispelings"><em>Typoes and Mispelings</em></a>
tackle the thorny subject of dealing with human
language through effective use of analyzers and queries. We start with
an easy approach to language analysis before diving into the complexities
of language, alphabets, and sorting. We cover stemming, stopwords, synonyms,
and fuzzy matching.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Chapters <a class="xref" href="aggs-high-level.html" title="High-Level Concepts"><em>High-Level Concepts</em></a> through <a class="xref" href="controlling-memory.html" title="Controlling Memory Use and Latency"><em>Controlling Memory Use and Latency</em></a>
discuss aggregations and analytics&#8212;&#8203;ways to summarize and group your data to show overall trends.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Chapters <a class="xref" href="geopoints.html" title="Geo Points"><em>Geo Points</em></a> through <a class="xref" href="geo-shapes.html" title="Geo Shapes"><em>Geo Shapes</em></a>
present the two approaches to geolocation
supported by Elasticsearch: lat/lon geo-points, and complex geo-shapes.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Chapters <a class="xref" href="relations.html" title="Handling Relationships"><em>Handling Relationships</em></a> through <a class="xref" href="scale.html" title="Designing for Scale"><em>Designing for Scale</em></a>
talk about how to model your data to work
most efficiently with Elasticsearch.  Representing relationships
between entities is not as easy in a search engine as it is in
a relational database, which has been designed for that purpose.
These chapters also explain how to suit your index design to
match the flow of data through your system.

<li class="listitem">
Finally, Chapters <a class="xref" href="cluster-admin.html" title="Monitoring"><em>Monitoring</em></a> through <a class="xref" href="post_deploy.html" title="Post-Deployment"><em>Post-Deployment</em></a>
discuss moving to production: the important configurations, what to monitor, and how to diagnose and prevent problems.
