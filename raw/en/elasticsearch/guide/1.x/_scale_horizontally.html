<p>What about scaling as the demand for our application grows? If we start a
third node, our cluster reorganizes itself to look like
<a class="xref" href="_scale_horizontally.html#cluster-three-nodes" title="A three-node cluster&#8212;&#8203;shards have been reallocated to spread the load">Figure 4, &#8220;A three-node cluster&#8212;&#8203;shards have been reallocated to spread the load&#8221;</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>One shard each from <code class="literal">Node 1</code> and <code class="literal">Node 2</code> have moved to the new
<code class="literal">Node 3</code>, and we have two shards per node, instead of three.
This means that the hardware resources (CPU, RAM, I/O) of each node
are being shared among fewer shards, allowing each shard to perform
better.</p>
<p>A shard is a fully fledged search engine in its own right, and is
capable of using all of the resources of a single node.  With our
total of six shards (three primaries and three replicas), our index is capable
of scaling out to a maximum of six nodes, with one shard on each node
and each shard having access to 100% of its node&#8217;s resources.</p>

<p>But what if we want to scale our search to more than six nodes?</p>
<p>The number of primary shards is fixed at the moment an index is created.
Effectively, that number defines the maximum amount of data that can be
<em>stored</em> in the index.  (The actual number depends on your data, your hardware
and your use case.) However, read requests&#8212;&#8203;searches or document retrieval&#8212;&#8203;can be handled by a primary <em>or</em> a replica shard, so the more copies of
data that you have, the more search throughput you can handle.</p>
<p>The number of replica shards can be changed dynamically on a live cluster,
allowing us to scale up or down as demand requires. Let&#8217;s increase the number
of replicas from the default of <code class="literal">1</code> to <code class="literal">2</code>:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sense">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sense">PUT /blogs/_settings
{
   "number_of_replicas" : 2
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="sense_widget" data-snippet="snippets/020_Distributed_Cluster/30_Replicas.json"></div>
<p>As can be seen in <a class="xref" href="_scale_horizontally.html#cluster-three-nodes-two-replicas" title="Increasing the number_of_replicas to 2">Figure 5, &#8220;Increasing the <code class="literal">number_of_replicas</code> to 2&#8221;</a>, the <code class="literal">blogs</code> index now
has nine shards: three primaries and six replicas. This means that we can scale out to
a total of nine nodes, again with one shard per node. This would allow us to
<em>triple</em> search performance compared to our original three-node cluster.</p>

<div class="note admon">

<div class="admon_content">
<p>Of course, just having more replica shards on the same number of nodes doesn&#8217;t
increase our performance at all because each shard has access to a smaller
fraction of its node&#8217;s resources.  You need to add hardware to increase
throughput.</p>
<p>But these extra replicas do mean that we have more redundancy: with the node
configuration above, we can now afford to lose two nodes without losing any
data.</p>
