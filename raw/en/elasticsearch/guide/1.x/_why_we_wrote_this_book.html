<p>We wrote this book because Elasticsearch needs a narrative.  The existing
reference documentation is excellent&#8212;&#8203;as long as you know what you are
looking for. It assumes that you are intimately familiar with information-retrieval concepts, distributed systems, the query DSL, and a host of other
topics.</p>
<p>This book makes no such assumptions.  It has been written so that a complete
beginner&#8212;&#8203;to both search and distributed systems&#8212;&#8203;can pick it up and start
building a prototype within a few chapters.</p>
<p>We have taken a problem-based approach: this is the problem, how do I solve
it, and what are the trade-offs of the alternative solutions? We start with the
basics, and each chapter builds on the preceding ones, providing practical
examples and explaining the theory where necessary.</p>
<p>The existing reference documentation explains <em>how</em> to use features.  We want
this book to explain <em>why</em> and <em>when</em> to use various features.</p>
