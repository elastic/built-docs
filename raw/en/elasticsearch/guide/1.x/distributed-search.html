<p>Before moving on, we are going to take a detour and talk about how search is
executed in a distributed environment.  It is a bit more complicated than the
basic <em>create-read-update-delete</em> (CRUD) requests that we discussed in
<a class="xref" href="distributed-docs.html" title="Distributed Document Store"><em>Distributed Document Store</em></a>.</p>

<p>The information presented in this chapter is for your interest. You are not required to
understand and remember all the detail in order to use Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>Read this chapter to gain a taste for how things work, and to know where the
information is in case you need to refer to it in the future, but don&#8217;t be
overwhelmed by the detail.</p>
</div>
<p>A CRUD operation deals with a single document that has a unique combination of
<code class="literal">_index</code>, <code class="literal">_type</code>, and <a class="xref" href="routing-value.html" title="Routing a Document to a Shard"><code class="literal">routing</code> values</a> (which defaults to the
document&#8217;s <code class="literal">_id</code>). This means that we know exactly which shard in the cluster
holds that document.</p>
<p>Search requires a more complicated execution model because we don&#8217;t know which
documents will match the query: they could be on any shard in the cluster. A
search request has to consult a copy of every shard in the index or indices
we&#8217;re interested in to see if they have any matching documents.</p>
<p>But finding all matching documents is only half the story. Results from
multiple shards must be combined into a single sorted list before the <code class="literal">search</code>
API can return a &#8220;page&#8221; of results. For this reason, search is executed in a
two-phase process called <em>query then fetch</em>.</p>
