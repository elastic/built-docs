<p>Our final topic in this chapter is about an internal aspect of Elasticsearch.
While we don&#8217;t demonstrate any new techniques here, fielddata is an
important topic that we will refer to repeatedly, and is something that you
should be aware of.</p>
<p>When you sort on a field, Elasticsearch needs access to the value of that
field for every document that matches the query.  The inverted index, which
performs very well when searching, is not the ideal structure for sorting on
field values:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
When searching, we need to be able to map a term to a list of documents.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
When sorting, we need to map a document to its terms. In other words, we
need to &#8220;uninvert&#8221; the inverted index.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To make sorting efficient, Elasticsearch loads all the values for
the field that you want to sort on into memory. This is referred to as
<em>fielddata</em>.</p>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Elasticsearch doesn&#8217;t just load the values for the documents that matched a
particular query. It loads the values from <em>every document in your index</em>,
regardless of the document <code class="literal">type</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The reason that Elasticsearch loads all values into memory is that uninverting the index
from disk is slow.  Even though you may need the values for only a few docs
for the current request, you will probably need access to the values for other
docs on the next request, so it makes sense to load all the values into memory
at once, and to keep them there.</p>
<p>Fielddata is used in several places in Elasticsearch:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Sorting on a field
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Aggregations on a field
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Certain filters (for example, geolocation filters)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Scripts that refer to fields
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Clearly, this can consume a lot of memory, especially for high-cardinality
string fields&#8212;&#8203;string fields that have many unique values&#8212;&#8203;like the body
of an email. Fortunately, insufficient memory is a problem that can be solved
by horizontal scaling, by adding more nodes to your cluster.</p>
<p>For now, all you need to know is what fielddata is, and to be aware that it
can be memory hungry.  Later, we will show you how to determine the amount of memory that fielddata
is using, how to limit the amount of memory that is available to it, and
how to preload fielddata to improve the user experience.</p>
