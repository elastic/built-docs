<p>Aggregations work via a data structure known as <em>fielddata</em> (briefly introduced
in <a class="xref" href="fielddata-intro.html" title="Fielddata">Fielddata</a>).  Fielddata is often the largest consumer of memory
in an Elasticsearch cluster, so it is important to understand how it works.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Fielddata can be loaded on the fly into memory, or built at index time and
stored on disk.  Later, we will talk about on-disk fielddata in
<a class="xref" href="doc-values.html" title="Doc Values">Doc Values</a>. For now we will focus on in-memory fielddata, as it is
currently the default mode of operation in Elasticsearch. This may well change
in a future version.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Fielddata exists because inverted indices are efficient only for certain operations.
The inverted index excels at finding documents that contain a term.  It does not
perform well in the opposite direction: determining which terms exist in a single
document. Aggregations need this secondary access pattern.</p>
<p>Consider the following inverted index:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">Term      Doc_1   Doc_2   Doc_3
------------------------------------
brown   |   X   |   X   |
dog     |   X   |       |   X
dogs    |       |   X   |   X
fox     |   X   |       |   X
foxes   |       |   X   |
in      |       |   X   |
jumped  |   X   |       |   X
lazy    |   X   |   X   |
leap    |       |   X   |
over    |   X   |   X   |   X
quick   |   X   |   X   |   X
summer  |       |   X   |
the     |   X   |       |   X
------------------------------------</pre>

<p>If we want to compile a complete list of terms in any document that mentions
<code class="literal">brown</code>, we might build a query like so:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">GET /my_index/_search
{
  "query" : {
    "match" : {
      "body" : "brown"
    }
  },
  "aggs" : {
    "popular_terms": {
      "terms" : {
        "field" : "body"
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>The query portion is easy and efficient.  The inverted index is sorted by
terms, so first we find <code class="literal">brown</code> in the terms list, and then scan across all the
columns to see which documents contain <code class="literal">brown</code>.  We can very quickly see that
<code class="literal">Doc_1</code> and <code class="literal">Doc_2</code> contain the token <code class="literal">brown</code>.</p>
<p>Then, for the aggregation portion, we need to find all the unique terms in
<code class="literal">Doc_1</code>  and <code class="literal">Doc_2</code>.  Trying to do this with the inverted index would be a
very expensive process: we would have to iterate over every term in the index
and collect tokens from <code class="literal">Doc_1</code>  and <code class="literal">Doc_2</code> columns.  This would be slow
and scale poorly: as the number of terms and  documents grows, so would the
execution time.</p>
<p>Fielddata addresses this problem by inverting the relationship. While the
inverted index maps terms to the documents containing the term, fielddata
maps documents to the terms contained by the document:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">Doc      Terms
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Doc_1 | brown, dog, fox, jumped, lazy, over, quick, the
Doc_2 | brown, dogs, foxes, in, lazy, leap, over, quick, summer
Doc_3 | dog, dogs, fox, jumped, over, quick, the
-----------------------------------------------------------------</pre>

<p>Once the data has been uninverted, it is trivial to collect the unique tokens from
<code class="literal">Doc_1</code> and <code class="literal">Doc_2</code>.  Go to the rows for each document, collect all the terms, and
take the union of the two sets.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The fielddata cache is per segment. In other words, when a new segment becomes
visible to search, the fielddata cached from old segments remains valid. Only
the data for the new segment needs to be loaded into memory.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thus, search and aggregations are closely intertwined.  Search finds documents
by using the inverted index.  Aggregations collect and aggregate values from
fielddata, which is itself generated from the inverted index.</p>
<p>The rest of this chapter covers various functionality that either
decreases fielddata&#8217;s memory footprint or increases execution speed.</p>

<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Fielddata is not just used for aggregations.  It is required for any
operation that needs to look up the value contained in a specific document.
Besides aggregations, this includes sorting, scripts that access field
values, parent-child relationships (see <a class="xref" href="parent-child.html" title="Parent-Child Relationship"><em>Parent-Child Relationship</em></a>), and certain types
of queries or filters, such as the <a class="xref" href="geo-distance.html" title="Geo Distance Filter"><code class="literal">geo_distance</code></a> filter.</p>
