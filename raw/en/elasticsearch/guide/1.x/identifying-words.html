<p>A word in English is relatively simple to spot: words are separated by
whitespace or (some) punctuation. Even in English, though, there can be
controversy: is <em>you&#8217;re</em> one word or two? What about <em>o&#8217;clock</em>,
<em>cooperate</em>, <em>half-baked</em>, or <em>eyewitness</em>?</p>
<p>Languages like German or Dutch combine individual words to create longer
compound words like <em>Weißkopfseeadler</em> (white-headed sea eagle), but in order
to be able to return <code class="literal">Weißkopfseeadler</code> as a result for the query <code class="literal">Adler</code>
(eagle), we need to understand how to break up compound words into their
constituent parts.</p>
<p>Asian languages are even more complex: some have no whitespace between words,
sentences, or even paragraphs. Some words can be represented by a single
character, but the same single character, when placed next to other
characters, can form just one part of a longer word with a quite different
meaning.</p>
<p>It should be obvious that there is no silver-bullet analyzer that will
miraculously deal with all human languages. Elasticsearch ships with dedicated
analyzers for many languages, and more language-specific analyzers are
available as plug-ins.</p>
<p>However, not all languages have dedicated analyzers, and sometimes you won&#8217;t
even be sure which language(s) you are dealing with.  For these situations, we
need good standard tools that do a reasonable job regardless of language.</p>
