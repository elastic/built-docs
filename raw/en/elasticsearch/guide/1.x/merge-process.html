<p>With the automatic refresh process creating a new segment every second, it
doesn&#8217;t take long for the number of segments to explode. Having too many
segments is a problem. Each segment consumes file handles, memory, and CPU
cycles.  More important, every search request has to check every segment in
turn; the more segments there are, the slower the search will be.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch solves this problem by merging segments in the background. Small
segments are merged into bigger segments, which, in turn, are merged into even
bigger segments.</p>
<p>This is the moment when those old deleted documents are purged from the filesystem.  Deleted documents (or old versions of updated documents) are not
copied over to the new bigger segment.</p>
<p>There is nothing you need to do to enable merging. It happens automatically
while you are indexing and searching. The process works like as depicted in <a class="xref" href="merge-process.html#img-merge" title="Two commited segments and one uncommited segment in the process of being merged into a bigger segment">Figure 25, &#8220;Two commited segments and one uncommited segment in the process of being merged into a bigger segment&#8221;</a>:</p>

<p>The merging of big segments can use a lot of I/O and CPU, which can hurt
search performance if left unchecked.  By default, Elasticsearch throttles the
merge process so that search still has enough resources available to perform
well.</p>

<p>The <code class="literal">optimize</code> API is best described as the <em>forced merge</em> API. It forces a
shard to be merged down to the number of segments specified in the
<code class="literal">max_num_segments</code> parameter. The intention is to reduce the number of
segments (usually to one) in order to speed up search performance.</p>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The <code class="literal">optimize</code> API should <em>not</em> be used on a dynamic index&#8212;&#8203;an
index that is being actively updated.  The background merge process does a
very good job, and optimizing will hinder the process. Don&#8217;t interfere!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In certain specific circumstances, the <code class="literal">optimize</code> API can be beneficial.
The typical use case is for logging, where logs are stored in an index per
day, week, or month.  Older indices are essentially read-only; they are
unlikely to change.</p>
<p>In this case, it can be useful to optimize the shards of an old index down to
a single segment each; it will use fewer resources and searches will be
quicker:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-json">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-json">POST /logstash-2014-10/_optimize?max_num_segments=1 <a id="CO40-1"></a><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i></pre>

<div class="admon_content">
<p>Be aware that merges triggered by the <code class="literal">optimize</code> API are not
throttled at all. They can consume all of the I/O on your nodes, leaving
nothing for search and potentially making your cluster unresponsive. If you
plan on optimizing an index, you should use shard allocation (see
<a class="xref" href="retiring-data.html#migrate-indices" title="Migrate Old Indices">Migrate Old Indices</a>) to first move the index to a node where it is safe to
run.</p>
