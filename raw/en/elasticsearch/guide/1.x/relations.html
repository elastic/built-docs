<p>In the real world, relationships matter: blog posts have comments, bank
accounts have transactions, customers have bank accounts, orders have order
lines, and directories have files and subdirectories.</p>
<p>Relational databases are specifically designed&#8212;&#8203;and this will not come as a
surprise to you&#8212;&#8203;to manage relationships:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Each entity (or <em>row</em>, in the relational world) can be uniquely identified
by a <em>primary key</em>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Entities are <em>normalized</em>. The data for a unique entity is stored only
once, and related entities store just its primary key. Changing the data of
an entity has to happen in only one place.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Entities can be joined at query time, allowing for cross-entity search.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Changes to a single entity are <em>atomic</em>, <em>consistent</em>, <em>isolated</em>, and
<em>durable</em>.  (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID_transactions" class="ulink" target="_top"><em>ACID Transactions</em></a>
for more on this subject.)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Most relational databases support ACID transactions across multiple
entities.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>But relational databases do have their limitations, besides their poor support
for full-text search. Joining entities at query time is expensive&#8212;&#8203;more
joins that are required, the more expensive the query.  Performing joins
between entities that live on different hardware is so expensive that it is
just not practical. This places a limit on the amount of data that can be
stored on a single server.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch, like most NoSQL databases, treats the world as though it were
flat. An index is a flat collection of independent documents. A single
document should contain all of the information that is required to decide
whether it matches a search request.</p>
<p>While changing the data of a single document in Elasticsearch is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID_transactions" class="ulink" target="_top">ACIDic</a>, transactions
involving multiple documents are not.  There is no way to roll back the index
to its previous state if part of a transaction fails.</p>
<p>This FlatWorld has its advantages:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Indexing is fast and lock-free.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Searching is fast and lock-free.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Massive amounts of data can be spread across multiple nodes, because each
document is independent of the others.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>But relationships matter.  Somehow, we need to bridge the gap between
FlatWorld and the real world. Four common techniques are used to manage
relational data in Elasticsearch:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="application-joins.html" title="Application-side Joins">Application-side joins</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="denormalization.html" title="Denormalizing Your Data">Data denormalization</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="nested-objects.html" title="Nested Objects">Nested objects</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="parent-child.html" title="Parent-Child Relationship">Parent/child relationships</a>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Often the final solution will require a mixture of a few of these techniques.</p>
