<p>Most languages of the world are <em>inflected</em>, meaning that words can change
their form to express differences in the following:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<em>Number</em>:      fox, foxes
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<em>Tense</em>:       pay, paid, paying
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<em>Gender</em>:      waiter, waitress
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<em>Person</em>:      hear, hears
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<em>Case</em>:        I, me, my
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<em>Aspect</em>:      ate, eaten
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<em>Mood</em>:        so be it, were it so
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>While inflection aids expressivity, it interferes with retrievability, as a
single root <em>word sense</em> (or meaning) may be represented by many different
sequences of letters. English is a weakly inflected language (you could
ignore inflections and still get reasonable search results), but some other
languages are highly inflected and need extra work in order to achieve
high-quality search results.</p>
<p><em>Stemming</em> attempts to remove the differences between inflected forms of a
word, in order to reduce each word to its root form. For instance <code class="literal">foxes</code> may
be reduced to the root <code class="literal">fox</code>, to remove the difference between singular and
plural in the same way that we removed the difference between lowercase and
uppercase.</p>
<p>The root form of a word may not even be a real word. The words <code class="literal">jumping</code> and
<code class="literal">jumpiness</code> may both be stemmed to <code class="literal">jumpi</code>. It doesn&#8217;t matter&#8212;&#8203;as long as
the same terms are produced at index time and at search time, search will just
work.</p>
<p>If stemming were easy, there would be only one implementation. Unfortunately,
stemming is an inexact science that suffers from two issues: understemming
and overstemming.</p>
<p><em>Understemming</em> is the failure to reduce words with the same meaning to the same
root. For example, <code class="literal">jumped</code> and <code class="literal">jumps</code> may be reduced to <code class="literal">jump</code>, while
<code class="literal">jumping</code> may be reduced to <code class="literal">jumpi</code>.  Understemming reduces retrieval
relevant documents are not returned.</p>
<p><em>Overstemming</em> is the failure to keep two words with distinct meanings separate.
For instance, <code class="literal">general</code> and <code class="literal">generate</code> may both be stemmed to <code class="literal">gener</code>.
Overstemming reduces precision: irrelevant documents are returned when they
shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>

<p class="title"><strong>Lemmatization</strong></p>
</div></div></div>
<p>A <em>lemma</em> is the canonical, or dictionary, form of a set of related words&#8212;&#8203;the
lemma of <code class="literal">paying</code>, <code class="literal">paid</code>, and <code class="literal">pays</code> is <code class="literal">pay</code>.  Usually the lemma resembles
the words it is related to but sometimes it doesn&#8217;t&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the lemma of <code class="literal">is</code>,
<code class="literal">was</code>, <code class="literal">am</code>, and <code class="literal">being</code> is <code class="literal">be</code>.</p>
<p>Lemmatization, like stemming, tries to group related words, but it goes one
step further than stemming in that it tries to group words by their <em>word
sense</em>, or meaning.  The same word may represent two  meanings&#x2014;for example,<em>wake</em> can mean <em>to wake up</em> or <em>a funeral</em>.  While lemmatization would
try to distinguish these two word senses, stemming would incorrectly conflate
them.</p>
<p>Lemmatization is a much more complicated and expensive process that needs to
understand the context in which words appear in order to make decisions
about what they mean. In practice, stemming appears to be just as effective
as lemmatization, but with a much lower cost.</p>

<p>First we will discuss the two classes of stemmers available in Elasticsearch&#x2014;<a class="xref" href="algorithmic-stemmers.html" title="Algorithmic Stemmers">Algorithmic Stemmers</a> and <a class="xref" href="dictionary-stemmers.html" title="Dictionary Stemmers">Dictionary Stemmers</a>&#x2014;and then look at how to
choose the right stemmer for your needs in <a class="xref" href="choosing-a-stemmer.html" title="Choosing a Stemmer">Choosing a Stemmer</a>.  Finally,
we will discuss options for tailoring stemming in <a class="xref" href="controlling-stemming.html" title="Controlling Stemming">Controlling Stemming</a> and
