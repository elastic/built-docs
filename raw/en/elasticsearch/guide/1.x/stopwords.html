<p>Back in the early days of information retrieval,  disk space and memory were
limited to a tiny fraction of what we are accustomed to today. It was
essential to make your index as small as possible.  Every kilobyte saved meant
a significant improvement in performance. Stemming (see <a class="xref" href="stemming.html" title="Reducing Words to Their Root Form"><em>Reducing Words to Their Root Form</em></a>) was
important, not just for making searches broader and increasing retrieval in
the same way that we use it today, but also as a tool for compressing index
size.</p>
<p>Another way to reduce index size is simply to <em>index fewer words</em>.  For search
purposes, some words are more important than others. A significant reduction
in index size can be achieved by indexing only the more important terms.</p>
<p>So which terms can be left out?  We can divide terms roughly into two groups:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Low-frequency terms
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Words that appear in relatively few documents in the collection.  Because of their
rarity, they have a high value, or <em>weight</em>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
High-frequency terms
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Common words that appear in many documents in the index, such as <code class="literal">the</code>, <code class="literal">and</code>, and
<code class="literal">is</code>. These words  have a low weight and contribute little to the relevance
score.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Of course, frequency is really a scale rather than just two points labeled
<em>low</em> and <em>high</em>. We just draw a line at some arbitrary point and say that any
terms below that line are low frequency and above the line are high frequency.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Which terms are low or high frequency depend on the documents themselves.  The
word <code class="literal">and</code> may be a low-frequency term if all the documents are in Chinese.
In a collection of documents about databases, the word <code class="literal">database</code> may be a
high-frequency term with little value as a search term for that particular
collection.</p>
<p>That said, for any language there are words that occur very
commonly and that seldom add value to a search.  The default English
stopwords used in Elasticsearch are as follows:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">a, an, and, are, as, at, be, but, by, for, if, in, into, is, it,
no, not, of, on, or, such, that, the, their, then, there, these,
they, this, to, was, will, with</pre>

<p>These <em>stopwords</em> can usually be filtered out before indexing with little
negative impact on retrieval. But is it a good idea to do so?</p>
