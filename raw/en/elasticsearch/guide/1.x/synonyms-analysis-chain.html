<p>The example we showed in <a class="xref" href="synonym-formats.html" title="Formatting Synonyms">Formatting Synonyms</a>,  used <code class="literal">u s a</code> as a synonym. Why
did we use that instead of <code class="literal">U.S.A.</code>?  The reason is that the <code class="literal">synonym</code> token
filter sees only the terms that the previous token filter or tokenizer has
emitted.</p>
<p>Imagine that we have an analyzer that consists of the <code class="literal">standard</code> tokenizer,
with the <code class="literal">lowercase</code> token filter followed by a <code class="literal">synonym</code> token filter. The
analysis process for the text <code class="literal">U.S.A.</code> would look like this:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-text">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-text">original string                  → "U.S.A."
standard           tokenizer     → (U),(S),(A)
lowercase          token filter  → (u),(s),(a)
synonym            token filter  → (usa)</pre>
</div>
<p>If we had specified the synonym as <code class="literal">U.S.A.</code>, it would never match anything
because, by the time <code class="literal">my_synonym_filter</code> sees the terms, the periods have been
removed and the letters have been lowercased.</p>
<p>This is an important point to consider.  What if we want to combine synonyms
with stemming, so that <code class="literal">jumps</code>, <code class="literal">jumped</code>, <code class="literal">jump</code>, <code class="literal">leaps</code>, <code class="literal">leaped</code>, and
<code class="literal">leap</code> are all indexed as the single term <code class="literal">jump</code>?  We could place the synonyms
filter before the stemmer and list all inflections:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">"jumps,jumped,leap,leaps,leaped =&gt; jump"</pre>

<p>But the more concise way would be to place the synonyms filter after the
stemmer, and to list just the root words that would be emitted by the stemmer:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">"leap =&gt; jump"</pre>

<h3 class="title"><a id="_case_sensitive_synonyms"></a>Case-Sensitive Synonyms<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-definitive-guide/edit/1.x/260_Synonyms/50_Analysis_chain.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
</div></div></div>
<p>Normally, synonym filters are placed after the <code class="literal">lowercase</code> token filter and so
all synonyms are written in lowercase, but sometimes that can lead to odd
conflations. For instance, a <code class="literal">CAT</code> scan and a <code class="literal">cat</code> are quite different, as
are <code class="literal">PET</code> (positron emmision tomography) and a <code class="literal">pet</code>. For that matter, the
surname <code class="literal">Little</code> is distinct from the adjective <code class="literal">little</code> (although if a
sentence starts with the adjective, it will be uppercased anyway).</p>
<p>If you need use case to distinguish between word senses, you will need to
place your synonym filter before the <code class="literal">lowercase</code> filter. Of course, that means
that your synonym rules would need to list all of the case variations that you
want to match (for example, <code class="literal">Little,LITTLE,little</code>).</p>
<p>Instead of that, you could have two synonym filters: one to catch the case-sensitive
synonyms and one for all the case-insentive synonyms.  For instance, the
case-sensitive rules could look like this:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">"CAT,CAT scan           =&gt; cat_scan"
"PET,PET scan           =&gt; pet_scan"
"Johnny Little,J Little =&gt; johnny_little"
"Johnny Small,J Small   =&gt; johnny_small"</pre>

<p>And the case-insentive rules could look like this:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">"cat                    =&gt; cat,pet"
"dog                    =&gt; dog,pet"
"cat scan,cat_scan scan =&gt; cat_scan"
"pet scan,pet_scan scan =&gt; pet_scan"
"little,small"</pre>

<p>The case-sensitive rules would <code class="literal">CAT scan</code> but would match only the
<code class="literal">CAT</code> in <code class="literal">CAT scan</code>. For this reason, we have the odd-looking rule <code class="literal">cat_scan
scan</code> in the case-insensitive list to catch bad replacements.</p>

<p>You can see how quickly it can get complicated. As always, the <code class="literal">analyze</code> API
is your friend&#8212;&#8203;use it to check that your analyzers are configured
correctly.  See <a class="xref" href="analysis-intro.html#analyze-api" title="Testing Analyzers">Testing Analyzers</a>.</p>
