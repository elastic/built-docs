<p>Without an <code class="literal">fsync</code> to flush data in the filesystem cache to disk, we cannot
be sure that the data will still be there after a power failure, or even after
exiting the application normally.  For Elasticsearch to be reliable, it needs
to ensure that changes are persisted to disk.</p>
<p>In <a class="xref" href="dynamic-indices.html" title="Dynamically Updatable Indices">Dynamically Updatable Indices</a>, we said that a full commit flushes segments to disk and
writes a commit point, which lists all known segments.  Elasticsearch uses
this commit point during startup or when reopening an index to decide which
segments belong to the current shard.</p>
<p>While we refresh once every second to achieve near real-time search, we still
need to do full commits regularly to make sure that we can recover from
failure.  But what about the document changes that happen between commits?  We
don&#8217;t want to lose those either.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch added a <em>translog</em>, or transaction log, which records every
operation in Elasticsearch as it happens.  With the translog, the process now
looks like this:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>When a document is indexed, it is added to the in-memory buffer <em>and</em>
appended to the translog, as shown in <a class="xref" href="translog.html#img-xlog-pre-refresh" title="New documents are added to the in-memory buffer and appended to the transaction log">Figure 21, &#8220;New documents are added to the in-memory buffer and appended to the transaction log&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>Every so often&#8212;&#8203;such as when the translog is getting too big&#8212;&#8203;the index

<p>The translog provides a persistent record of all operations that have not yet
been flushed to disk. When starting up, Elasticsearch will use the last commit
point to recover known segments from disk, and will then replay all operations
in the translog to add the changes that happened after the last commit.</p>
<p>The translog is also used to provide real-time CRUD.  When you try to
retrieve, update, or delete a document by ID, it first checks the translog for
any recent changes before trying to retrieve the document from the relevant
segment. This means that it always has access to the latest known version of
the document, in real-time.</p>

<p>The action of performing a commit and truncating the translog is known in
Elasticsearch as a <em>flush</em>.  Shards are flushed automatically every 30
minutes, or when the translog becomes too big. See the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/index-modules-translog.html" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">translog</code> documentation</a> for settings
that can be used to control these thresholds:</p>
<p>The <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/indices-flush.html" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">flush</code> API</a> can be used to perform a manual flush:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-json">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-json">POST /blogs/_flush <a id="CO39-1"></a><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i>

POST /_flush?wait_for_ongoing <a id="CO39-2"></a><i class="conum" data-value="2"></i></pre>
</div>
<div class="calloutlist">
<table border="0" summary="Callout list">
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO39-1"><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i></a></p>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>Flush the <code class="literal">blogs</code> index.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO39-2"><i class="conum" data-value="2"></i></a></p>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>Flush all indices and wait until all flushes have completed before
returning.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>You seldom need to issue a manual <code class="literal">flush</code> yourself; usually, automatic
flushing is all that is required.</p>
<p>That said, it is beneficial to <a class="xref" href="translog.html#flush-api" title="flush API">flush</a> your indices before restarting a node or closing an index. When Elasticsearch tries to recover or reopen an index, it has to replay all of the operations in the translog, so the shorter the log, the faster the recovery.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div>
<p class="title"><strong>How Safe Is the Translog?</strong></p>
</div></div></div>
<p>The purpose of the translog is to ensure that operations are not lost.  This
begs the question: how safe is the translog?</p>
<p>Writes to a file will not survive a reboot until the file has been
<code class="literal">fsync</code>'ed to disk.  By default, the translog is <code class="literal">fsync</code>'ed every 5
seconds. Potentially, we could lose 5 seconds worth of data&#8212;&#8203;if the translog
were the only mechanism that we had for dealing with failure.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the translog is only part of a much bigger system.  Remember that
an indexing request is considered successful only after it has  completed
on both the primary shard and all replica shards.  Even if the node holding
the primary shard were to suffer catastrophic failure, it would be unlikely to
affect the nodes holding the replica shards at the same time.</p>
<p>While we could force the translog to <code class="literal">fsync</code> more frequently (at the cost of
indexing performance), it is unlikely to provide more reliability.</p>
