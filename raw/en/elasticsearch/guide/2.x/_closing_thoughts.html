<p>This section covered a lot of ground, and a lot of deeply technical issues.
Aggregations bring a power and flexibility to Elasticsearch that is hard to
overstate. The ability to nest buckets and metrics, to quickly approximate
cardinality and percentiles, to find statistical anomalies in your data, all
while operating on near-real-time data and in parallel to full-text search&#8212;&#8203;these are game-changers to many organizations.</p>
<p>It is a feature that, once you start using it, you&#8217;ll find dozens
of other candidate uses.  Real-time reporting and analytics is central to many
 organizations (be it over business intelligence or server logs).</p>
<p>Elasticsearch has made great strides in becoming more memory friendly by defaulting
to doc values for <em>most</em> fields, but the necessity of fielddata for string fields
means you must remain vigilant.</p>
<p>The management of this memory can take several forms, depending on your
particular use-case:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
During the planning stage, attempt to organize your data so that aggregations are
run on <code class="literal">not_analyzed</code> strings instead of analyzed so that doc values may be leveraged.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
While testing, verify that analysis chains are not creating high cardinality
fields which are later aggregated on
</li>
<li class="listitem">
At search time, by utilizing approximate aggregations and data filtering
</li>
<li class="listitem">
At a node level, by setting hard memory and dynamic circuit-breaker limits
</li>
<li class="listitem">
At an operations level, by monitoring memory usage and controlling slow garbage-collection cycles,
potentially by adding more nodes to the cluster
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Most deployments will use one or more of the preceding methods.  The exact combination
is highly dependent on your particular environment.</p>
<p>Whatever the path you take, it is important to assess the available options and
create both a short- and long-term plan.  Decide how your memory situation exists
today and what (if anything) needs to be done.  Then decide what will happen in
six months or one year as your data grows. What methods will you use to continue
scaling?</p>
<p>It is better to plan out these life cycles of your cluster ahead of time, rather
than panicking at 3 a.m. because your cluster is at 90% heap utilization.</p>
