<p>The  DSL used by
Elasticsearch has a single set of components called queries, which can be mixed
and matched in endless combinations.  This single set of components can be used
in two contexts: filtering context and query context.</p>
<p>When used in <em>filtering context</em>, the query is said to be a "non-scoring" or "filtering"
query.  That is, the query simply asks the question: "Does this document match?".
The answer is always a simple, binary yes|no.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Is the <code class="literal">created</code> date in the range <code class="literal">2013</code> - <code class="literal">2014</code>?
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Does the <code class="literal">status</code> field contain the term <code class="literal">published</code>?
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Is the <code class="literal">lat_lon</code> field within <code class="literal">10km</code> of a specified point?
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When used in a <em>querying context</em>, the query becomes a "scoring" query.  Similar to
its non-scoring sibling, this determines <em>if</em> a document matches and
how <em>well</em> the document matches.</p>
<p>A typical use for a query is to find documents:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Best matching the words <code class="literal">full text search</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Containing the word <code class="literal">run</code>, but maybe also matching <code class="literal">runs</code>, <code class="literal">running</code>,
<code class="literal">jog</code>, or <code class="literal">sprint</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Containing the words <code class="literal">quick</code>, <code class="literal">brown</code>, and <code class="literal">fox</code>&#x2014;the closer together they
are, the more relevant the document
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Tagged with <code class="literal">lucene</code>,  <code class="literal">search</code>, or <code class="literal">java</code>&#x2014;the more tags, the more
relevant the document
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>A scoring query calculates how <em>relevant</em> each document is to the
query, and assigns it a relevance <code class="literal">_score</code>, which is later used to
sort matching documents by relevance. This concept of relevance is
well suited to full-text search, where there is seldom a completely
&#8220;correct&#8221; answer.</p>

<p>Historically, queries and filters were separate components in Elasticsearch.  Starting
in Elasticsearch 2.0, filters were technically eliminated, and all queries gained
the ability to become non-scoring.</p>
<p>However, for clarity and simplicity, we will use the term "filter" to mean a query which
is used in a non-scoring, filtering context.  You can think of the terms "filter",
"filtering query" and "non-scoring query" as being identical.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the term "query" is used in isolation without a qualifier, we are
referring to a "scoring query".</p>

<p>Filtering queries are simple checks for set inclusion/exclusion, which make them
very fast to compute.  There are various optimizations that can be leveraged
when at least one of your filtering query is "sparse" (few matching documents),
and frequently used non-scoring queries can be cached in memory for faster access.</p>
<p>In contrast, scoring queries have to not only find
matching documents, but also calculate how relevant each document is, which typically makes
them heavier than their non-scoring counterparts.  Also, query results are not cacheable.</p>
<p>Thanks to the inverted index, a simple scoring query that matches just a few documents
may perform as well or better than a filter that spans millions
of documents.  In general, however, a filter will outperform a
scoring query.  And it will do so consistently.</p>
<p>The goal of filtering is to <em>reduce the number of documents that have to
be examined by the scoring queries</em>.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>As a general rule, use
query clauses for <em>full-text</em> search or for any condition that should affect the
<em>relevance score</em>, and use filters for everything else.</p>
