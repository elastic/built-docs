<p>With all of the aggregation examples given so far, you may have noticed that we
omitted a <code class="literal">query</code> from the search request.  The entire request was
simply an aggregation.</p>
<p>Aggregations can be run at the same time as search requests, but you need to
understand a new concept: <em>scope</em>.  By default, aggregations operate in the same
scope as the query.  Put another way, aggregations are calculated on the set of
documents that match your query.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at one of our first aggregation examples:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sense">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sense">GET /cars/transactions/_search
{
    "size" : 0,
    "aggs" : {
        "colors" : {
            "terms" : {
              "field" : "color"
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="sense_widget" data-snippet="snippets/300_Aggregations/40_scope.json"></div>
<p>You can see that the aggregation is in isolation.  In reality, Elasticsearch
assumes "no query specified" is equivalent to "query all documents." The preceding
query is internally translated as follows:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sense">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sense">GET /cars/transactions/_search
{
    "size" : 0,
    "query" : {
        "match_all" : {}
    },
    "aggs" : {
        "colors" : {
            "terms" : {
              "field" : "color"
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="sense_widget" data-snippet="snippets/300_Aggregations/40_scope.json"></div>
<p>The aggregation always operates in the scope of the query, so an isolated
aggregation really operates in the scope of a <code class="literal">match_all</code> query&#8212;&#8203;that is to say,
all documents.</p>
<p>Once armed with the knowledge of scoping, we can start to customize
aggregations even further.  All of our previous examples calculated statistics
about <em>all</em> of the data: top-selling cars, average price of all cars, most sales
per month, and so forth.</p>
<p>With scope, we can ask questions such as "How many colors are Ford cars
available in?"  We do this by simply adding a query to the request (in this case
a <code class="literal">match</code> query):</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sense">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sense">GET /cars/transactions/_search
{
    "query" : {
        "match" : {
            "make" : "ford"
        }
    },
    "aggs" : {
        "colors" : {
            "terms" : {
              "field" : "color"
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="sense_widget" data-snippet="snippets/300_Aggregations/40_scope.json"></div>
<p>Since we aren&#8217;t specifying <code class="literal">"size" : 0</code>, both the search
results and the aggregation results are returned:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">{
...
   "hits": {
      "total": 2,
      "max_score": 1.6931472,
      "hits": [
         {
            "_source": {
               "price": 25000,
               "color": "blue",
               "make": "ford",
               "sold": "2014-02-12"
            }
         },
         {
            "_source": {
               "price": 30000,
               "color": "green",
               "make": "ford",
               "sold": "2014-05-18"
            }
         }
      ]
   },
   "aggregations": {
      "colors": {
         "buckets": [
            {
               "key": "blue",
               "doc_count": 1
            },
            {
               "key": "green",
               "doc_count": 1
            }
         ]
      }
   }
}</pre>

<p>This may seem trivial, but it is the key to advanced and powerful dashboards.
You can transform any static dashboard into a real-time data exploration device
by adding a search bar.  This allows the user to search for terms and see all
of the graphs (which are powered by aggregations, and thus scoped to the query)
update in real time.  Try that with Hadoop!</p>
<h3><a id="_global_bucket"></a>Global Bucket<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-definitive-guide/edit/2.x/300_Aggregations/40_scope.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You&#8217;ll often want your aggregation to be scoped to your query.  But sometimes
you&#8217;ll want to search for a subset of data, but aggregate across <em>all</em> of
your data.</p>
<p>For example, say you want to know the average price of Ford cars compared to the
average price of <em>all</em> cars. We can use a regular aggregation (scoped to the query)
to get the first piece of information.  The second piece of information can be
obtained by using a <code class="literal">global</code> bucket.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">global</code> bucket will contain <em>all</em> of your documents, regardless of the query
scope; it bypasses the scope completely.  Because it is a bucket, you can nest
aggregations inside it as usual:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sense">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sense">GET /cars/transactions/_search
{
    "size" : 0,
    "query" : {
        "match" : {
            "make" : "ford"
        }
    },
    "aggs" : {
        "single_avg_price": {
            "avg" : { "field" : "price" } <a id="CO197-1"></a><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i>
        },
        "all": {
            "global" : {}, <a id="CO197-2"></a><i class="conum" data-value="2"></i>
            "aggs" : {
                "avg_price": {
                    "avg" : { "field" : "price" } <a id="CO197-3"></a><i class="conum" data-value="3"></i>
                }

            }
        }
    }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="sense_widget" data-snippet="snippets/300_Aggregations/40_scope.json"></div>
<div class="calloutlist">
<table border="0" summary="Callout list">
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO197-1"><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i></a></p>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>This aggregation operates in the query scope (for example, all docs matching <code class="literal">ford</code>)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO197-2"><i class="conum" data-value="2"></i></a></p>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>The <code class="literal">global</code> bucket has no parameters.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO197-3"><i class="conum" data-value="3"></i></a></p>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>This aggregation operates on the all documents, regardless of the make.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>The <code class="literal">single_avg_price</code> metric calculation is based on all documents that fall under the
query scope&#8212;&#8203;all <code class="literal">ford</code> cars.  The <code class="literal">avg_price</code> metric is nested under a
<code class="literal">global</code> bucket, which means it ignores scoping entirely and calculates on
all the documents.  The average returned for that aggregation represents
the average price of all cars.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve made it this far in the book, you&#8217;ll recognize the mantra: use a filter
wherever you can.  The same applies to aggregations, and in the next chapter
we show you how to filter an aggregation instead of just limiting the query
scope.</p>
