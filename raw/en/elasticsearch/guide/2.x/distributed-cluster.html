<p class="title"><strong>Supplemental Chapter</strong></p>
</div></div></div>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this is the first of several supplemental chapters
about how Elasticsearch operates in a distributed environment.  In this
chapter, we explain commonly used terminology like <em>cluster</em>, <em>node</em>, and
<em>shard</em>, the mechanics of how Elasticsearch scales out, and how it deals with
hardware failure.</p>
<p>Although this chapter is not required reading&#8212;&#8203;you can use Elasticsearch for
a long time without worrying about shards, replication, and failover&#8212;&#8203;it will
help you to understand the processes at work inside Elasticsearch. Feel free
to skim through the chapter and to refer to it again later.</p>

<p>Elasticsearch is built to be always available, and to scale with your needs.
Scale can come from buying bigger servers (<em>vertical scale</em>, or <em>scaling up</em>)
or from buying more servers (<em>horizontal scale</em>, or <em>scaling out</em>).</p>
<p>While Elasticsearch can benefit from more-powerful hardware, vertical scale
has its limits. Real scalability comes from horizontal scale&#8212;&#8203;the ability to
add more nodes to the cluster and to spread load and reliability between them.</p>
<p>With most databases, scaling horizontally usually requires a major overhaul of
your application to take advantage of these extra boxes. In contrast,
Elasticsearch is <em>distributed</em> by nature: it knows how to manage multiple
nodes to provide scale and high availability.  This also means that your
application doesn&#8217;t need to care about it.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we show how you can set up your cluster,
nodes, and shards to scale with your needs and to ensure that your data is
safe from hardware failure.</p>
