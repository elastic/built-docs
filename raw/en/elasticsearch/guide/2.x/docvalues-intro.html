<p>Our final topic in this chapter is about an internal aspect of Elasticsearch.
While we don&#8217;t demonstrate any new techniques here, doc values are an
important topic that we will refer to repeatedly, and is something that you
should be aware of.</p>
<p>When you sort on a field, Elasticsearch needs access to the value of that
field for every document that matches the query.  The inverted index, which
performs very well when searching, is not the ideal structure for sorting on
field values:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
When searching, we need to be able to map a term to a list of documents.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
When sorting, we need to map a document to its terms. In other words, we
need to &#8220;uninvert&#8221; the inverted index.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This &#8220;uninverted&#8221; structure is often called a &#8220;column-store&#8221; in other systems.
Essentially, it stores all the values for a single field together in a single
column of data, which makes it very efficient for operations like sorting.</p>
<p>In Elasticsearch, this column-store is known as <em>doc values</em>, and is enabled
by default. Doc values are created at index-time: when a field is indexed, Elasticsearch
adds the tokens to the inverted index for search.  But it also extracts the terms
and adds them to the columnar doc values.</p>
<p>Doc values are used in several places in Elasticsearch:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Sorting on a field
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Aggregations on a field
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Certain filters (for example, geolocation filters)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Scripts that refer to fields
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Because doc values are serialized to disk, we can leverage the OS to help keep
access fast.  When the "working set" is smaller than the available memory on a node,
the OS will naturally keep all the doc values hot in memory, leading to very fast
access.  When the "working set" is much larger than available memory, the OS will
naturally start to page doc-values on/off disk without running into the dreaded
OutOfMemory exception.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk about doc values in much greater depth later.  For now, all you need
to know is that sorting (and some other operations) happen on a parallel data
structure which is built at index-time.</p>
