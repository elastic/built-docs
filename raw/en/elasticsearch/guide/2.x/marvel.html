<p><a href="/guide/en/marvel/current/index.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Marvel</a> enables
you to easily monitor Elasticsearch through Kibana. You can view your
cluster’s health and performance in real time as well as analyze
past cluster, index, and node metrics.</p>
<p>While you can access a large number of statistics through the APIs described
in this chapter, they only show you what&#8217;s going on at a single point in time.
Knowing memory usage at this instant is helpful, but knowing
memory usage <em>over time</em> is much more useful. Marvel queries and aggregates
the metrics so you can visualize your cluster&#8217;s
behavior over time, which makes it easy to spot trends.</p>
<p>As your cluster grows, the output from the stats APIs can get truly hairy.
Once you have a dozen nodes, let alone a hundred, reading through stacks of JSON
becomes very tedious. Marvel lets you explore the data interactively and
makes it easy to zero in on what&#8217;s going on with particular nodes or indices.</p>
<p>Marvel uses the same stats APIs that are available to you&#8212;&#8203;it does not expose
any statistics that you can&#8217;t access through the APIs.  However, Marvel greatly
simplifies the collection and visualization of those statistics.</p>
<p>Marvel is free to use (even in production!), so you should definitely try it out!
