<p>To add data to Elasticsearch, we need an <em>index</em>&#x2014;a place to store related
data.  In reality, an index is just a <em>logical namespace</em> that points to
one or more physical <em>shards</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>shard</em> is a low-level <em>worker unit</em> that holds just a slice of all the
data in the index. In <a class="xref" href="inside-a-shard.html" title="Inside a Shard"><em>Inside a Shard</em></a>, we explain in detail how a
shard works, but for now it is enough to know that a shard is a single
instance of Lucene, and is a complete search engine in its own right. Our
documents are stored and indexed in shards, but our applications don&#8217;t talk to
them directly. Instead, they talk to an index.</p>
<p>Shards are how Elasticsearch distributes data around your cluster. Think of
shards as containers for data. Documents are stored in shards, and shards are
allocated to nodes in your cluster. As your cluster grows or shrinks,
Elasticsearch will automatically migrate shards between nodes so that the
cluster remains balanced.</p>
<p>A shard can be either a <em>primary</em> shard or a <em>replica</em> shard. Each document in
your index belongs to a single primary shard, so the number of primary shards
that you have determines the maximum amount of data that your index can hold.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>While a primary shard can technically contain up to Integer.MAX_VALUE - 128 documents,
the practical limit depends on your use case: the hardware you have, the size and
complexity of your documents, how you index and query your documents, and your
expected response times.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A replica shard is just a copy of a primary shard. Replicas are used to provide
redundant copies of your data to protect against hardware failure, and to
serve read requests like searching or retrieving a document.</p>
<p>The number of primary shards in an index is fixed at the time that an index is
created, but the number of replica shards can be changed at any time.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s create an index called <code class="literal">blogs</code> in our empty one-node cluster. By
default, indices are assigned five primary shards, but for the purpose of this
demonstration, we&#8217;ll assign just three primary shards and one replica (one replica
of every primary shard):</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sense">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sense">PUT /blogs
{
   "settings" : {
      "number_of_shards" : 3,
      "number_of_replicas" : 1
   }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="sense_widget" data-snippet="snippets/020_Distributed_Cluster/15_Add_index.json"></div>
<p>Our cluster now looks like <a class="xref" href="_add_an_index.html#cluster-one-node" title="A single-node cluster with an index">Figure 2, &#8220;A single-node cluster with an index&#8221;</a>. All three primary shards have been allocated to <code class="literal">Node 1</code>.</p>

<p>If we were to check the
<a class="xref" href="cluster-health.html" title="Cluster Health"><code class="literal">cluster-health</code></a> now, we would see this:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">

<div class="calloutlist">

</div>
<p>A cluster health of <code class="literal">yellow</code> means that all <em>primary</em> shards are up and
running (the cluster is capable of serving any request successfully) but
not  all <em>replica</em> shards are active.  In fact, all three replica shards
are currently <code class="literal">unassigned</code>&#x2014;they haven&#8217;t been allocated to a node. It
doesn&#8217;t make sense to store copies of the same data on the same node. If we
were to lose that node, we would lose all copies of our data.</p>
<p>Currently, our cluster is fully functional but at risk of data loss in case of
hardware failure.</p>
