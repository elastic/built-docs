<p>The <code class="literal">bool</code> query is the mainstay of multiclause queries. It works well
for many cases, especially when you are able to map different query strings to
individual fields.</p>
<p>The problem is that, these days, users expect to be able to type all of their
search terms into a single field, and expect that the application will figure out how
to give them the right results.  It is ironic that the multifield search form
is known as <em>Advanced Search</em>&#x2014;it may appear advanced to the user, but it is
much simpler to implement.</p>
<p>There is no simple <em>one-size-fits-all</em> approach to multiword, multifield
queries.  To get the best results, you have to <em>know your data</em> and know how
to use the appropriate tools.</p>

<p>When your only user input is a single query string, you will encounter three scenarios frequently:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Best fields
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
When searching for words that represent a concept, such as &#8220;brown fox,&#8221; the
words mean more together than they do individually. Fields like the <code class="literal">title</code>
and <code class="literal">body</code>, while related, can be considered to be in competition with each
other. Documents should have as many words as possible in <em>the same field</em>,
and the score should come from the <em>best-matching field</em>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Most fields
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>A common technique for fine-tuning relevance is to index the same data into
multiple fields, each with its own analysis chain.</p>
<p>The main field may contain words in their stemmed form, synonyms, and words
stripped of their <em>diacritics</em>, or accents. It is used to match as many
documents as possible.</p>
<p>The same text could then be indexed in other fields to provide more-precise
matching.  One field may contain the unstemmed version, another the original
word with accents, and a third might use <em>shingles</em> to provide information
about <a class="xref" href="proximity-matching.html" title="Proximity Matching">word proximity</a>.</p>
<p>These other fields act as <em>signals</em> to increase the relevance score of each
matching document. The <em>more fields that match</em>, the better.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Cross fields
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>For some entities, the identifying information is spread across multiple
fields, each of which contains just a part of the whole:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Person: <code class="literal">first_name</code> and <code class="literal">last_name</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Book: <code class="literal">title</code>, <code class="literal">author</code>, and <code class="literal">description</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Address:  <code class="literal">street</code>, <code class="literal">city</code>, <code class="literal">country</code>, and <code class="literal">postcode</code>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In this case, we want to find as many words as possible in <em>any</em> of the listed
fields. We need to search across multiple fields as if they were one big
field.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>All of these are multiword, multifield queries, but each requires a
different strategy. We will examine each strategy in turn in the rest of this
chapter.</p>
