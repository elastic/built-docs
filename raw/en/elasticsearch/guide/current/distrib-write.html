<p>Create, index, and delete requests are <em>write</em> operations, which must be
successfully completed on the primary shard before they can be copied to any
associated replica shards, as shown in <a class="xref" href="distrib-write.html#img-distrib-write" title="Creating, indexing, or deleting a single document">Figure 9, &#8220;Creating, indexing, or deleting a single document&#8221;</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Here is the sequence of steps necessary to successfully create, index, or
delete a document on both the primary and any replica shards:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The client sends a create, index, or delete request to <code class="literal">Node 1</code>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The node uses the document&#8217;s <code class="literal">_id</code> to determine that the document
belongs to shard <code class="literal">0</code>. It forwards the request to <code class="literal">Node 3</code>,
where the primary copy of shard <code class="literal">0</code> is currently allocated.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">Node 3</code> executes the request on the primary shard. If it is successful,
it forwards the request in parallel to the replica shards on <code class="literal">Node 1</code> and
<code class="literal">Node 2</code>. Once all of the replica shards report success, <code class="literal">Node 3</code> reports
success to the coordinating node, which reports success to the client.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>By the time the client receives a successful response, the document change has
been executed on the primary shard and on all replica shards. Your change is
safe.</p>
<p>There are a number of optional request parameters that allow you to influence
this process, possibly increasing performance at the cost of data security.
These options are seldom used because Elasticsearch is already fast, but they
are explained here for the sake of completeness:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">consistency</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>By default, the primary shard requires a <em>quorum</em>, or majority, of shard copies
(where a shard copy can be a primary or a replica shard) to be available
before even attempting a write operation. This is to prevent writing data to the
&#8220;wrong side&#8221; of a network partition.  A quorum is defined as follows:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">int( (primary + number_of_replicas) / 2 ) + 1</pre>

<p>The allowed values for <code class="literal">consistency</code> are <code class="literal">one</code> (just the primary shard), <code class="literal">all</code>
(the primary and all replicas), or the default <code class="literal">quorum</code>, or majority, of shard
copies.</p>
<p>Note that the <code class="literal">number_of_replicas</code> is the number of replicas <em>specified</em> in
the index settings, not the number of replicas that are currently active.  If
you have specified that an index should have three replicas, a quorum would
be as follows:</p>
<pre class="literallayout">int( (primary + 3 replicas) / 2 ) + 1 = 3</pre>

<p>But if you start only two nodes, there will be insufficient active shard
copies to satisfy the quorum, and you will be unable to index or delete any
documents.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">timeout</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>What happens if insufficient shard copies are available? Elasticsearch waits,
in the hope that more shards will appear.  By default, it will wait up to 1
minute. If you need to, you can use the <code class="literal">timeout</code> parameter to make it abort
sooner: <code class="literal">100</code> is 100 milliseconds, and <code class="literal">30s</code> is 30 seconds.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>A new index has <code class="literal">1</code> replica by default, which means that two active shard
copies <em>should</em> be required in order to satisfy the need for a <code class="literal">quorum</code>.
However, these default settings would prevent us from doing anything useful
with a single-node cluster.  To avoid this problem, the requirement for
a quorum is enforced only when <code class="literal">number_of_replicas</code> is greater than <code class="literal">1</code>.</p>
