<p>When updating a document with the <code class="literal">index</code> API, we read the original document,
make our changes, and then reindex the <em>whole document</em> in one go. The most recent
indexing request wins: whichever document was indexed last is the one stored
in Elasticsearch. If somebody else had changed the document in the meantime,
their changes would be lost.</p>
<p>Many times, this is not a problem.  Perhaps our main data store is a
relational database, and we just copy the data into Elasticsearch to make it
searchable. Perhaps there is little chance of two people changing the same
document at the same time. Or perhaps it doesn&#8217;t really matter to our business
if we lose changes occasionally.</p>
<p>But sometimes losing a change is <em>very important</em>.  Imagine that we&#8217;re using
Elasticsearch to store the number of widgets that we have in stock in our
online store. Every time that we sell a widget, we decrement the stock count
in Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>One day, management decides to have a sale. Suddenly, we are selling several
widgets every second. Imagine two web processes, running in parallel, both
processing the sale of one widget each, as shown in <a class="xref" href="version-control.html#img-data-lww" title="Consequence of no concurrency control">Figure 7, &#8220;Consequence of no concurrency control&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>The change that <code class="literal">web_1</code> made to the <code class="literal">stock_count</code> has been lost because
<code class="literal">web_2</code> is unaware that its copy of the <code class="literal">stock_count</code> is out-of-date. The
result is that we think we have more widgets than we actually do, and we&#8217;re
going to disappoint customers by selling them stock that doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>The more frequently that changes are made, or the longer the gap between
reading data and updating it, the more likely it is that we will lose changes.</p>
<p>In the database world, two approaches are commonly used to ensure that
changes are not lost when making concurrent updates:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>Pessimistic concurrency control</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Widely used by relational databases, this approach assumes that conflicting changes are
likely to happen and so blocks access to a resource in order to prevent
conflicts. A typical example is locking a row before reading its data,
ensuring that only the thread that placed the lock is able to make changes to
the data in that row.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>Optimistic concurrency control</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Used by Elasticsearch,  this approach assumes that conflicts are unlikely to happen and
doesn&#8217;t block operations from being attempted. However, if the underlying data
has been modified between reading and writing, the update will fail. It is
then up to the application to decide how it should resolve the conflict. For
instance, it could reattempt the update, using the fresh data, or it could
report the situation to the user.
