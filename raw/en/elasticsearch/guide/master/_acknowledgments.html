<p>Why are spouses always relegated to a <em>last but not least</em> disclaimer?
There is no doubt in our minds that the two people most deserving of our
gratitude are Xavi Sánchez Catalán, Clinton&#8217;s long-suffering husband, and
Genevieve Flanders, Zach&#8217;s fiancée. They have looked after us and loved us,
picked up the slack, put up with our absence and our endless moaning about how
long the book was taking, and, most importantly, they are still here.</p>
<p>Thank you to Shay Banon for creating Elasticsearch in the first place, and to
Elastic the company for supporting our work on the book.  Our colleagues
at Elastic deserve a big thank you as well. They have helped us pick
through the innards of Elasticsearch to really understand how it works, and
they have been responsible for adding improvements and fixing inconsistencies
that were brought to light by writing about them.</p>
<p>Two colleagues in particular deserve special mention:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Robert Muir patiently shared his deep knowledge of search in general and
Lucene in particular. Several chapters are the direct result of joining
his pearls of wisdom into paragraphs.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Adrien Grand dived deep into the code to answer question after question,
and checked our explanations to ensure they make sense.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Thank you to O&#8217;Reilly for undertaking this project and working with us to make
this book available online for free, to our editor Brian Anderson for cajoling
us along gently, and to our kind and gentle reviewers Benjamin Devèze, Ivan
Brusic, and Leo Lapworth.  Your reassurances kept us hopeful.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to thank our readers, some of whom we know only by
their GitHub identities, who have taken the time to report problems, provide
corrections, or suggest improvements:</p>
