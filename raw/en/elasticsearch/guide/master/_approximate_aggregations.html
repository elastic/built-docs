<p>Life is easy if all your data fits on a single machine.  Classic algorithms
taught in CS201 will be sufficient for all your needs.  But if all your data fits
on a single machine, there would be no need for distributed software
like Elasticsearch at all.  But once you start distributing data, algorithm
selection needs to be made carefully.</p>
<p>Some algorithms are amenable to distributed execution.  All of the aggregations
discussed thus far execute in a single pass and give exact results. These types
of algorithms are often referred to as <em>embarrassingly parallel</em>,
because they parallelize to multiple machines with little effort.  When
performing a <code class="literal">max</code> metric, for example, the underlying algorithm is very simple:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Broadcast the request to all shards.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Look at the <code class="literal">price</code> field for each document.  If <code class="literal">price &gt; current_max</code>, replace
<code class="literal">current_max</code> with <code class="literal">price</code>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Return the maximum price from all shards to the coordinating node.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Find the maximum price returned from all shards.  This is the true maximum.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The algorithm scales linearly with machines because the algorithm requires no
coordination (the machines don&#8217;t need to discuss intermediate results), and the
memory footprint is very small (a single integer representing the maximum).</p>
<p>Not all algorithms are as simple as taking the maximum value, unfortunately.
More complex operations require algorithms that make conscious trade-offs in
performance and memory utilization. There is a triangle of factors at play:
big data, exactness, and real-time latency.</p>
<p>You get to choose two from this triangle:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Exact + real time
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Your data fits in the RAM of a single machine.  The world
is your oyster; use any algorithm you want. Results will be 100% accurate and
relatively fast.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Big data + exact
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A classic Hadoop installation.  Can handle petabytes of data
and give you exact answers&#8212;&#8203;but it may take a week to give you that answer.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Big data + real time
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Approximate algorithms that give you accurate, but not
exact, results.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Elasticsearch currently supports two approximate algorithms (<code class="literal">cardinality</code> and
<code class="literal">percentiles</code>).  These will give you accurate results, but not 100% exact.
In exchange for a little bit of estimation error, these algorithms give you
fast execution and a small memory footprint.</p>
<p>For <em>most</em> domains, highly accurate results that return <em>in real time</em> across
<em>all your data</em> is more important than 100% exactness. At first blush, this may be an alien concept to you. <em>"We need exact answers!"</em>
you may yell.  But consider the implications of a 0.5% error:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The true 99th percentile of latency for your website is 132ms.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
An approximation with 0.5% error will be within +/- 0.66ms of 132ms.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The approximation returns in milliseconds, while the "true" answer may take seconds, or
be impossible.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For simply checking on your website&#8217;s latency, do you care if the approximate
answer is 132.66ms instead of 132ms?  Certainly, not all domains can tolerate
approximations&#8212;&#8203;but the vast majority will have no problem.  Accepting
an approximate answer is more often a <em>cultural</em> hurdle rather than a business
or technical imperative.</p>
