<p>We&#8217;ve said that Elasticsearch can cope when nodes fail, so let&#8217;s go
ahead and try it out. If we kill the first node, our cluster looks like
<a class="xref" href="_coping_with_failure.html#cluster-post-kill" title="Cluster after killing one node">Figure 6, &#8220;Cluster after killing one node&#8221;</a>.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 6. Cluster after killing one node</div>
</div>
<p>The node we killed was the master node. A cluster must have a master node in
order to function correctly, so the first thing that happened was that the
nodes elected a new master: <code class="literal">Node 2</code>.</p>
<p>Primary shards <code class="literal">1</code> and <code class="literal">2</code> were lost when we killed <code class="literal">Node 1</code>, and our index
cannot function properly if it is missing primary shards. If we had checked
the cluster health at this point, we would have seen status <code class="literal">red</code>: not all
primary shards are active!</p>
<p>Fortunately, a complete copy of the two lost primary shards exists on other
nodes, so the first thing that the new master node did was to promote the
replicas of these shards on <code class="literal">Node 2</code> and <code class="literal">Node 3</code> to be primaries, putting us
back into cluster health <code class="literal">yellow</code>.  This promotion process was instantaneous,
like the flick of a switch.</p>
<p>So why is our cluster health <code class="literal">yellow</code> and not <code class="literal">green</code>? We have all three primary
shards, but we specified that we wanted two replicas of each primary, and
currently only one replica is assigned. This prevents us from reaching
<code class="literal">green</code>, but we&#8217;re not too worried here: were we to kill <code class="literal">Node 2</code> as well, our
application could <em>still</em> keep running without data loss, because <code class="literal">Node 3</code>
contains a copy of every shard.</p>
<p>If we restart <code class="literal">Node 1</code>, the cluster would be able to allocate the missing
replica shards, resulting in a state similar to the one described in
<a class="xref" href="_scale_horizontally.html#cluster-three-nodes-two-replicas" title="Increasing the number_of_replicas to 2">Figure 5, &#8220;Increasing the <code class="literal">number_of_replicas</code> to 2&#8221;</a>.  If <code class="literal">Node 1</code> still has copies of the old
shards, it will try to reuse them, copying over from the primary shard
only the files that have changed in the meantime.</p>
<p>By now, you should have a reasonable idea of how shards allow Elasticsearch to
scale horizontally and to ensure that your data is safe. Later we will examine
the life cycle of a shard in more detail.</p>
