<p>As discussed way back in <a class="xref" href="_scale_horizontally.html" title="Scale Horizontally">Scale Horizontally</a>, Elasticsearch will
automatically balance shards between your available nodes, both when new nodes
are added and when existing nodes leave.</p>
<p>Theoretically, this is the best thing to do. We want to recover missing
primaries by promoting replicas as soon as possible. We also want to make sure
resources are balanced evenly across the cluster to prevent hotspots.</p>
<p>In practice, however, immediately re-balancing can cause more problems than it
solves. For example, consider this situation:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Node 19 loses connectivity to your network (someone tripped on the power
cable)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Immediately, the master notices the node departure. It determines what
primary shards were on Node 19 and promotes the corresponding replicas around
the cluster
</li>
<li class="listitem">
After replicas have been promoted to primary, the master begins issuing
recovery commands to rebuild the now-missing replicas. Nodes around the cluster
fire up their NICs and start pumping shard data to each other in an attempt to
get back to green health status
</li>
<li class="listitem">
This process will likely trigger a small cascade of shard movement, since the
cluster is now unbalanced. Unrelated shards will be moved between hosts to
accomplish better balancing
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Meanwhile, the hapless admin who kicked out the power cable plugs it back in.
Node 19 reboots and rejoins the cluster. Unfortunately, the node is informed
that its existing data is now useless; the data being re-allocated elsewhere. So
Node 19 deletes its local data and begins recovering a different set of shards
from the cluster (which then causes a new minor re-balancing dance).</p>
<p>If this all sounds needless and expensive, you&#8217;re right. It is, but <em>only when
you know the node will be back soon</em>. If Node 19 was truly gone, the above
procedure is exactly what we want to happen.</p>
<p>To help address these transient outages, Elasticsearch has the ability to delay
shard allocation. This gives your cluster time to see if nodes will rejoin
before starting the re-balancing dance.</p>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div>
<div class="position-relative"><h3 class="title"><a id="_changing_the_default_delay"></a>Changing the default delay</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-definitive-guide/edit/master/520_Post_Deployment/35_delayed_shard_allocation.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
</div></div></div>
<p>By default, the cluster will wait one minute to see if the node will rejoin. If
the node rejoins before the timer expires, the rejoining node will use its
existing shards and no shard allocation occurs.</p>
<p>This default time can be changed either globally, or on a per-index basis, by
configuring the <code class="literal">delayed_timeout</code> setting:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">PUT /_all/_settings <a id="CO309-1"></a><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i>
{
  "settings": {
    "index.unassigned.node_left.delayed_timeout": "5m" <a id="CO309-2"></a><i class="conum" data-value="2"></i>
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="calloutlist">
<table border="0" summary="Callout list">
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO309-1"><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i></a></p>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>By using the <code class="literal">_all</code> index name, we can apply this setting to all indices in
the cluster</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO309-2"><i class="conum" data-value="2"></i></a></p>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>The default time is changed to 5 minutes</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>The setting is dynamic and can be changed at runtime. If you would like shards
to allocate immediately instead of waiting, you can set <code class="literal">delayed_timeout: 0</code>.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Delayed allocation won&#8217;t prevent replicas from being promoted to
primaries. The cluster will still perform promotions as necessary to get the
cluster back to <code class="literal">yellow</code> status. The allocation of the now-missing replicas will
be the only process that is delayed</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="position-relative"><h3 class="title"><a id="_auto_cancellation_of_shard_relocation"></a>Auto-cancellation of shard relocation</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-definitive-guide/edit/master/520_Post_Deployment/35_delayed_shard_allocation.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
</div></div></div>
<p>What happens if the node comes back <em>after</em> the timeout expires, but before the
cluster has finished moving shards around? In this case, Elasticsearch will
check to see if the on-disk data matches the current "live" data in the primary
shard. If the two shards are identical&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;meaning there have been no new
documents, updates or deletes&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the master will cancel the on-going rebalancing
and restore the on-disk data.</p>
<p>This is done since recovery of on-disk data will always be faster than
transferring over the network, and since we can guarantee the shards are
identical, the process is a win-win.</p>
<p>If the shards have diverged (e.g. new documents have been indexed since the node
went down), the recovery process will continue as normal. The rejoining node
will delete it&#8217;s local, out-dated shards and obtain a new set.</p>
