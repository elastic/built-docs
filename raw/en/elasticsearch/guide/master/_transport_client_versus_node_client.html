<p>If you are using Java, you may wonder when to use the transport client versus
the node client. As discussed at the beginning of the book, the transport client
acts as a communication layer between the cluster and your application. It knows
the API and can automatically round-robin between nodes, sniff the cluster for
you, and more. But it is <em>external</em> to the cluster, similar to the REST clients.</p>
<p>The node client, on the other hand, is actually a node within the cluster (but
does not hold data, and cannot become master). Because it is a node, it knows
the entire cluster state (where all the nodes reside, which shards live in which
nodes, and so forth). This means it can execute APIs with one less network hop.</p>
<p>There are uses-cases for both clients:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>The transport client is ideal if you want to decouple your application from
the cluster. For example, if your application quickly creates and destroys
connections to the cluster, a transport client is much "lighter" than a node
client, since it is not part of a cluster.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you need to create thousands of connections, you don&#8217;t want to
have thousands of node clients join the cluster. The TC will be a better choice.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
On the flipside, if you need only a few long-lived, persistent connection
objects to the cluster, a node client can be a bit more efficient since it knows
the cluster layout. But it ties your application into the cluster, so it may
pose problems from a firewall perspective.
