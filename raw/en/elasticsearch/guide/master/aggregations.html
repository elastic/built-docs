<p>Until this point, this book has been dedicated to search.  With search,
we have a query and we want to find a subset of documents that
match the query.  We are looking for the proverbial needle(s) in the
haystack.</p>
<p>With aggregations, we zoom out to get an overview of our data.  Instead of
looking for individual documents, we want to analyze and summarize our complete
set of data:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
How many needles are in the haystack?
</li>
<li class="listitem">
What is the average length of the needles?
</li>
<li class="listitem">
What is the median length of the needles, broken down by manufacturer?
</li>
<li class="listitem">
How many needles were added to the haystack each month?
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Aggregations can answer more subtle questions too:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
What are your most popular needle manufacturers?
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Are there any unusual or anomalous clumps of needles?
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Aggregations allow us to ask sophisticated questions of our data.  And yet, while
the functionality is completely different from search, it leverages the
same data-structures.  This means aggregations execute quickly and are
<em>near real-time</em>, just like search.</p>
<p>This is extremely powerful for reporting and dashboards.  Instead of performing
<em>rollups</em> of your data (<em>that crusty Hadoop job that takes a week to run</em>),
you can visualize your data in real time, allowing you to respond immediately.
Your report changes as your data changes, rather than being pre-calculated, out of
date and irrelevant.</p>
<p>Finally, aggregations operate alongside search requests. This means you can
both search/filter documents <em>and</em> perform analytics at the same time, on the
same data, in a single request.  And because aggregations are calculated in the
context of a user&#8217;s search, you&#8217;re not just displaying a count of four-star hotels&#8212;&#8203;you&#8217;re displaying a count of four-star hotels that <em>match their search criteria</em>.</p>
<p>Aggregations are so powerful that many companies have built large Elasticsearch
clusters solely for analytics.</p>
