<p>Databases that deal purely in structured data (such as dates, numbers, and
string enums) have it easy: they just have to check whether a document (or a
row, in a relational database) matches the query.</p>
<p>While Boolean yes/no matches are an essential part of full-text search, they
are not enough by themselves. Instead, we also  need to know how relevant each
document is to the query.  Full-text search engines have to not only find the
matching documents, but also sort them by relevance.</p>
<p>Full-text relevance formulae, or <em>similarity algorithms</em>,  combine several
factors to produce a single relevance <code class="literal">_score</code> for each document.  In this
chapter, we examine the various moving parts and discuss how they can be
controlled.</p>
<p>Of course, relevance is not just about full-text queries; it may need to
take structured data into account as well. Perhaps we are looking for a
vacation home with particular features (air-conditioning, sea view, free
WiFi).  The more features that a property has, the more relevant it is. Or
perhaps we want to factor in sliding scales like recency, price, popularity, or
distance, while still taking the relevance of a full-text query into account.</p>
<p>All of this is possible thanks to the powerful scoring infrastructure
available in Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>We will start by looking at the theoretical side of how Lucene calculates
relevance, and then move on to practical examples of how you can control the
process.</p>
