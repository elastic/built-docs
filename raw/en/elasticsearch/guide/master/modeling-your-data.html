<p>Elasticsearch is a different kind of beast, especially if you come from the
world of SQL.  It comes with many benefits: performance, scale, near real-time
search, and analytics across massive amounts of data. And it is easy to get
going! Just download and start using it.</p>
<p>But it is not magic.  To get the most out of Elasticsearch, you need to
understand how it works and how to make it work for your needs.</p>
<p>Handling relationships between entities is not as obvious as it is with a
dedicated relational store.  The golden rule of a relational database&#8212;&#8203;normalize your data&#8212;&#8203;does not apply to Elasticsearch. In <a class="xref" href="relations.html" title="Handling Relationships"><em>Handling Relationships</em></a>,
<a class="xref" href="nested-objects.html" title="Nested Objects"><em>Nested Objects</em></a>, and <a class="xref" href="parent-child.html" title="Parent-Child Relationship"><em>Parent-Child Relationship</em></a> we discuss the pros and cons of
the available approaches.</p>
<p>Then in <a class="xref" href="scale.html" title="Designing for Scale"><em>Designing for Scale</em></a> we talk about the features that Elasticsearch offers
that enable you to scale out quickly and flexibly.  Scale is not  one-size-fits-all.  You need to think about how data flows through your system, and
design your model accordingly. Time-based data like log events or social
network streams require a very different approach than more static collections
of documents.</p>
<p>And finally, we talk about the one thing in Elasticsearch that doesn&#8217;t scale.</p>
