<p>Without an <code class="literal">fsync</code> to flush data in the filesystem cache to disk, we cannot
be sure that the data will still be there after a power failure, or even after
exiting the application normally.  For Elasticsearch to be reliable, it needs
to ensure that changes are persisted to disk.</p>
<p>In <a class="xref" href="dynamic-indices.html" title="Dynamically Updatable Indices">Dynamically Updatable Indices</a>, we said that a full commit flushes segments to disk and
writes a commit point, which lists all known segments.  Elasticsearch uses
this commit point during startup or when reopening an index to decide which
segments belong to the current shard.</p>
<p>While we refresh once every second to achieve near real-time search, we still
need to do full commits regularly to make sure that we can recover from
failure.  But what about the document changes that happen between commits?  We
don&#8217;t want to lose those either.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch added a <em>translog</em>, or transaction log, which records every
operation in Elasticsearch as it happens.  With the translog, the process now
looks like this:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>When a document is indexed, it is added to the in-memory buffer <em>and</em>
appended to the translog, as shown in <a class="xref" href="translog.html#img-xlog-pre-refresh" title="New documents are added to the in-memory buffer and appended to the transaction log">Figure 21, &#8220;New documents are added to the in-memory buffer and appended to the transaction log&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>The translog provides a persistent record of all operations that have not yet
been flushed to disk. When starting up, Elasticsearch will use the last commit
point to recover known segments from disk, and will then replay all operations
in the translog to add the changes that happened after the last commit.</p>
<p>The translog is also used to provide real-time CRUD.  When you try to
retrieve, update, or delete a document by ID, it first checks the translog for
any recent changes before trying to retrieve the document from the relevant
segment. This means that it always has access to the latest known version of
the document, in real-time.</p>

<p>The action of performing a commit and truncating the translog is known in
Elasticsearch as a <em>flush</em>.  Shards are flushed automatically every 30
minutes, or when the translog becomes too big. See the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/index-modules-translog.html" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">translog</code> documentation</a> for settings
that can be used to control these thresholds:</p>
<p>The <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/indices-flush.html" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">flush</code> API</a> can be used to perform a manual flush:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-json">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-json">POST /blogs/_flush <a id="CO40-1"></a><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i>

POST /_flush?wait_for_ongoing <a id="CO40-2"></a><i class="conum" data-value="2"></i></pre>
</div>
<div class="calloutlist">
<table border="0" summary="Callout list">
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO40-1"><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i></a></p>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>Flush the <code class="literal">blogs</code> index.</p>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>You seldom need to issue a manual <code class="literal">flush</code> yourself; usually, automatic
flushing is all that is required.</p>
<p>That said, it is beneficial to <a class="xref" href="translog.html#flush-api" title="flush API">flush</a> your indices before restarting a node or closing an index. When Elasticsearch tries to recover or reopen an index, it has to replay all of the operations in the translog, so the shorter the log, the faster the recovery.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<a id="how-safe-is-the-translog"></a>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div>
<p class="title"><strong>How Safe Is the Translog?</strong></p>
</div></div></div>
<p>The purpose of the translog is to ensure that operations are not lost.  This
begs the question: how safe is the translog?</p>
<p>Writes to a file will not survive a reboot until the file has been
<code class="literal">fsync</code>'ed to disk.  By default, the translog is <code class="literal">fsync</code>'ed every 5
seconds <em>and</em> after a write request completes (e.g. index, delete, update, bulk).
This process occurs on both the primary and replica shards. Ultimately, that means
your client won&#8217;t receive a <code class="literal">200 OK</code> response until the entire request has been
<code class="literal">fsync</code>'ed in the translog of the primary and all replicas.</p>
<p>Executing an fsync after every request does come with some performance cost,
although in practice it is relatively small (especially for bulk ingestion, which
amortizes the cost over many documents in the single request).</p>
<p>But for some high-volume clusters where losing a few seconds of data is not
critical, it can be advantageous to fsync <em>asynchronously</em>.  E.g. writes are
buffered in memory and <code class="literal">fsync</code>'ed together every 5s.</p>
<p>This behavior can be enabled by setting the <code class="literal">durability</code> parameter to <code class="literal">async</code>:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">PUT /my_index/_settings
{
    "index.translog.durability": "async",
    "index.translog.sync_interval": "5s"
}</pre>
</div>
<p>This setting can be configured per-index and is dynamically updatable. If
you decide to enable async translog behavior, you are <em>guaranteed</em> to lose
<code class="literal">sync_interval</code>'s worth of data if a crash happens.  Please be aware of this
characteristic before deciding!</p>
<p>If you are unsure the ramifications of this action, it is best to use the default
(<code class="literal">"index.translog.durability": "request"</code>) to avoid data-loss.</p>
