<h3>Deprecated in 5.5.0.</h3>
<p>Elasticsearch on YARN is deprecated and will be removed in 6.0</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Distributed as part of Elasticsearch for Apache Hadoop, Elasticsearch on YARN is a separate, stand-alone, self-contained CLI (command-line interface) that allows Elasticsearch to run (and thus be managed) within a <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html" class="ulink" target="_top">YARN</a> environment.</p>
<p>In other words, Elasticsearch can use YARN to allocate its resources and be started and stopped, on said resources, through YARN infrastructure.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT:
Currently, due to the inherent limitations in YARN, Elasticsearch for Apache Hadoop is in <span class="strong strong"><strong>beta</strong></span>; that is we encourage users to try it out and report feedback however it <em>might</em> not contain all the features needed for production usage (most of which can be addressed outside YARN).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, YARN does not (currently) provide comprehensive support for long-running services; features such as storage/network/host affinity, topology information and broadcasting (in particular in case of restarts) and ip/storage provisioning are missing; while there are solutions for them, these are outside YARN which is far from ideal.</p>
<p>However this topic is addressed within the YARN community - as it progresses, the new functionality will be incorporated into this project and once completed, the project will be promoted out of beta.</p>
