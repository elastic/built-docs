<p>A runtime field is a field that is evaluated at query time. When you define a
runtime field, you can immediately use it in search requests, aggregations,
filtering, and sorting.</p>
<p>When defining a runtime field, you can include a Painless script that is
evaluated at query time. This script has access to the entire context of a
document, including the original <code class="literal">_source</code> and any mapped fields plus their
values. At query time, the script runs and generates values for each scripted
field that is included in the query.</p>
<p>You can map a runtime field in the <code class="literal">runtime</code> section under the mapping
definition, or define runtime fields that exist only as part of a search
request. The script syntax is the same, regardless of where you define the
runtime field.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>When defining a Painless script to use with runtime fields, you must
include <code class="literal">emit</code> to return calculated values.</p>

<h4><a id="painless-runtime-fields-mapping"></a>Define a runtime field in the mapping<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/painless/painless-guide/painless-runtime-fields.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Add a <code class="literal">runtime</code> section under the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/runtime-mapping-fields.html" class="ulink" target="_top">mapping definition</a> to explore your data without indexing fields.</p>
<p>The script in the following request extracts the day of the week from the
<code class="literal">@timestamp</code> field, which is defined as a <code class="literal">date</code> type. The script calculates
the day of the week based on the value of <code class="literal">@timestamp</code>, and uses <code class="literal">emit</code> to
return the calculated value.</p>

<h4><a id="painless-runtime-fields-query"></a>Define a runtime field only in a search request<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/master/docs/painless/painless-guide/painless-runtime-fields.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Use runtime fields in a search request to create a field that exists
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/runtime-search-request.html" class="ulink" target="_top">only as part of the query</a>. You can also <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/runtime-override-values.html" class="ulink" target="_top">override field values</a> at query time for existing fields without
modifying the field itself.</p>
<p>This flexibility allows you to experiment with your data schema and fix
mistakes in your index mapping without reindexing your data.</p>
<p>In the following request, the values for the <code class="literal">day_of_week</code> field are calculated
dynamically, and only within the context of this search request:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET my-index/_search
{
  "runtime_mappings": {
    "day_of_week": {
      "type": "keyword",
      "script": {
        "source":
        """emit(doc['@timestamp'].value.dayOfWeekEnum
