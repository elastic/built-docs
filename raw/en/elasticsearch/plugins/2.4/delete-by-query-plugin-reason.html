<p>The old delete-by-query API in Elasticsearch 1.x was fast but problematic. We
decided to remove the feature from Elasticsearch for these reasons:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Forward compatibility
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The old implementation wrote a delete-by-query request, including the
query, to the transaction log.  This meant that, when upgrading to a new
version, old unsupported queries which cannot be executed might exist in
the translog, thus causing data corruption.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Consistency and correctness
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The old implementation executed the query and deleted all matching docs on
the primary first.  It then repeated this procedure on each replica shard.
There was no guarantee that the queries on the primary and the replicas
matched the same document, so it was quite possible to end up with
different documents on each shard copy.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Resiliency
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The old implementation could cause out-of-memory exceptions, merge storms,
and dramatic slow downs if used incorrectly.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a id="_new_delete_by_query_implementation"></a>New delete-by-query implementation<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/2.4/docs/plugins/delete-by-query.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The new implementation, provided by this plugin, is built internally
using  <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/search-request-scroll.html" class="ulink" target="_top">scroll</a> to return
the document IDs and versions of all the documents that need to be deleted.
It then uses  the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/docs-bulk.html" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">bulk</code> API</a> to do the actual deletion.</p>
<p>This can have performance as well as visibility implications. Delete-by-query
now has the following semantics:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
non-atomic
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A delete-by-query may fail at any time while some documents matching the
query have already been deleted.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
try-once
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A delete-by-query may fail at any time and will not retry it&#8217;s execution.
All retry logic is left to the user.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
syntactic sugar
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A delete-by-query is equivalent to a scroll search ordered by <code class="literal">_doc</code> and
corresponding bulk-deletes by ID.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
point-in-time
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A delete-by-query will only delete the documents that are visible at the
point in time the delete-by-query was started, equivalent to the
scan/scroll API.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
consistent
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A delete-by-query will yield consistent results across all replicas of a
shard.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
forward-compatible
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A delete-by-query will only send IDs to the shards as deletes such that no
queries are stored in the transaction logs that might not be supported in
the future.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
visibility
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The effect of a delete-by-query request will not be visible to search
until the user refreshes the index, or the index is refreshed
automatically.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>The new implementation suffers from two issues, which is why we decided to
move the functionality to a plugin instead of replacing the feature in core:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
It is not as fast as the previous implementation. For most use cases, this
difference should not be noticeable but users running delete-by-query on
many matching documents may be affected.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
There is currently no way to monitor or cancel a running delete-by-query
request, except for the <code class="literal">timeout</code> parameter.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We have plans to solve both of these issues in a later version of Elasticsearch.</p>
