<p>This section contains some other information about designing and managing an
Elasticsearch cluster on your own AWS infrastructure. If you would prefer to avoid these
operational details then you may be interested in a hosted Elasticsearch installation
available on AWS-based infrastructure from <a href="/cloud" class="ulink" target="_top">https://www.elastic.co/cloud</a>.</p>

<p>EC2 instances offer a number of different kinds of storage. Please be aware of
the following when selecting the storage for your cluster:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Instance
Store</a> is recommended for Elasticsearch clusters as it offers excellent performance and
is cheaper than EBS-based storage. Elasticsearch is designed to work well with this kind
of ephemeral storage because it replicates each shard across multiple nodes. If
a node fails and its Instance Store is lost then Elasticsearch will rebuild any lost
shards from other copies.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/" class="ulink" target="_top">EBS-based storage</a> may be acceptable
for smaller clusters (1-2 nodes). Be sure to use provisioned IOPS to ensure
your cluster has satisfactory performance.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs/" class="ulink" target="_top">EFS-based storage</a> is not
recommended or supported as it does not offer satisfactory performance.
Historically, shared network filesystems such as EFS have not always offered
precisely the behaviour that Elasticsearch requires of its filesystem, and this has been
known to lead to index corruption. Although EFS offers durability, shared
storage, and the ability to grow and shrink filesystems dynamically, you can
achieve the same benefits using Elasticsearch directly.

<p>Prefer the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/" class="ulink" target="_top">Amazon Linux 2 AMIs</a> as these

<ul class="itemizedlist">

Smaller instance types have limited network performance, in terms of both
<a href="https://lab.getbase.com/how-we-discovered-limitations-on-the-aws-tcp-stack/" class="ulink" target="_top">bandwidth
and number of connections</a>. If networking is a bottleneck, avoid
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/" class="ulink" target="_top">instance types</a> with networking
labelled as <code class="literal">Moderate</code> or <code class="literal">Low</code>.

It is a good idea to distribute your nodes across multiple
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html" class="ulink" target="_top">availability
zones</a> and use <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/modules-cluster.html#shard-allocation-awareness" class="ulink" target="_top">shard
allocation awareness</a> to ensure that each shard has copies in more than one
availability zone.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Do not span a cluster across regions. Elasticsearch expects that node-to-node
connections within a cluster are reasonably reliable and offer high bandwidth
and low latency, and these properties do not hold for connections between
regions. Although an Elasticsearch cluster will behave correctly when node-to-node
connections are unreliable or slow, it is not optimised for this case and its
performance may suffer. If you wish to geographically distribute your data, you
should provision multiple clusters and use features such as
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/modules-cross-cluster-search.html" class="ulink" target="_top">cross-cluster search</a> and
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/xpack-ccr.html" class="ulink" target="_top">cross-cluster replication</a>.

If you have split your nodes into roles, consider
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html" class="ulink" target="_top">tagging the

termination protection</a> for all of your data and master-eligible nodes. This
will help to prevent accidental termination of these nodes which could

If running your cluster using one or more

termination during scale-in</a>. This will help to prevent automatic termination
of these nodes which could temporarily reduce the resilience of the cluster and
which could cause a potentially disruptive reallocation of shards. If these
instances are protected against termination during scale-in then you can use

migrate any data off these nodes before terminating them manually.
