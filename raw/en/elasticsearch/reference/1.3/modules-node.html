<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>elasticsearch</strong></span> allows to configure a node to either be allowed to store
data locally or not. Storing data locally basically means that shards of
different indices are allowed to be allocated on that node. By default,
each node is considered to be a data node, and it can be turned off by
setting <code class="literal">node.data</code> to <code class="literal">false</code>.</p>
<p>This is a powerful setting allowing to create 2 types of  non-data nodes:
dedicated master nodes and client nodes.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>client nodes</strong></span> are smart load
balancers that take part in some of the processing steps.
Lets take an example:</p>
<p>We can start a whole cluster of data nodes which do not even start an
HTTP transport by setting <code class="literal">http.enabled</code> to <code class="literal">false</code>. Such nodes will
communicate with one another using the
<a class="xref" href="modules-transport.html" title="Transport">transport</a> module. In front
of the cluster we can start one or more "client" nodes which will
start with HTTP enabled.  These client nodes will have the settings <code class="literal">node.data: false</code>
and <code class="literal">node.master: false</code>.  All HTTP communication will be performed
through these client nodes.</p>
<p>These "client" nodes are still part of the cluster, and
they can redirect operations exactly to the node that holds the relevant
data without having to query all nodes.  However, they do not store data and also do not perform cluster
management operations.  The other benefit is the fact that for scatter / gather based
operations (such as search), since the client nodes will start the scatter process, they will perform the
actual gather processing.  This relieves the data nodes to do the heavy duty of indexing and
searching, without needing to process HTTP requests (parsing), overload
the network, or perform the gather processing.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>dedicated master nodes</strong></span> are nodes with the settings <code class="literal">node.data: false</code>
and <code class="literal">node.master: true</code>.  We actively promote the use of dedicated master nodes in critical clusters to
make sure that there are 3 dedicated nodes whose only role is to be master, a lightweight operational (cluster management)
responsibility.  By reducing the amount of resource intensive work that these nodes do (in other words, do not send index
or search requests to these dedicated master nodes),
we greatly reduce the chance of cluster instability.</p>
