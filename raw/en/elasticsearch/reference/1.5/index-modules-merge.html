<p>A shard in elasticsearch is a Lucene index, and a Lucene index is broken
down into segments. Segments are internal storage elements in the index
where the index data is stored, and are immutable up to delete markers.
Segments are, periodically, merged into larger segments to keep the
index size at bay and expunge deletes.</p>
<p>The more segments one has in the Lucene index means slower searches and
more memory used. Segment merging is used to reduce the number of segments,
however merges can be expensive to perform, especially on low IO environments.
Merges can be throttled using <a class="xref" href="index-modules-store.html#store-throttling" title="Store Level Throttling">store level throttling</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="policy"></a>Policy<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/1.5/docs/reference/index-modules/merge.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The index merge policy module allows one to control which segments of a
shard index are to be merged. There are several types of policies with
the default set to <code class="literal">tiered</code>.</p>
<h4><a id="tiered"></a>tiered<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/1.5/docs/reference/index-modules/merge.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Merges segments of approximately equal size, subject to an allowed
number of segments per tier. This is similar to <code class="literal">log_bytes_size</code> merge
policy, except this merge policy is able to merge non-adjacent segment,
and separates how many segments are merged at once from how many
segments are allowed per tier. This merge policy also does not
over-merge (i.e., cascade merges).</p>
<p>This policy has the following settings:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">index.merge.policy.expunge_deletes_allowed</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
When expungeDeletes is called, we only merge away a segment if its delete
percentage is over this threshold. Default is <code class="literal">10</code>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">index.merge.policy.floor_segment</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Segments smaller than this are "rounded up" to this size, i.e. treated as
equal (floor) size for merge selection. This is to prevent frequent
flushing of tiny segments, thus preventing a long tail in the index. Default
is <code class="literal">2mb</code>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">index.merge.policy.max_merge_at_once</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Maximum number of segments to be merged at a time during "normal" merging.
Default is <code class="literal">10</code>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">index.merge.policy.max_merge_at_once_explicit</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Maximum number of segments to be merged at a time, during optimize or
expungeDeletes. Default is <code class="literal">30</code>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">index.merge.policy.max_merged_segment</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Maximum sized segment to produce during normal merging (not explicit
optimize). This setting is approximate: the estimate of the merged segment
size is made by summing sizes of to-be-merged segments (compensating for
percent deleted docs). Default is <code class="literal">5gb</code>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">index.merge.policy.segments_per_tier</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Sets the allowed number of segments per tier. Smaller values mean more
merging but fewer segments. Default is <code class="literal">10</code>. Note, this value needs to be
&gt;= than the <code class="literal">max_merge_at_once</code> otherwise you&#8217;ll force too many merges to
occur.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">index.merge.policy.reclaim_deletes_weight</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Controls how aggressively merges that reclaim more deletions are favored.
Higher values favor selecting merges that reclaim deletions. A value of
<code class="literal">0.0</code> means deletions don&#8217;t impact merge selection. Defaults to <code class="literal">2.0</code>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">index.compound_format</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Should the index be stored in compound format or not. Defaults to <code class="literal">false</code>.
See <a class="xref" href="index-modules.html#index-compound-format"><code class="literal">index.compound_format</code></a> in
<a class="xref" href="index-modules.html#index-modules-settings" title="Index Settings">Index Settings</a>.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>For normal merging, this policy first computes a "budget" of how many
segments are allowed to be in the index. If the index is over-budget,
then the policy sorts segments by decreasing size (proportionally considering percent
deletes), and then finds the least-cost merge. Merge cost is measured by
a combination of the "skew" of the merge (size of largest seg divided by
smallest seg), total merge size and pct deletes reclaimed, so that
merges with lower skew, smaller size and those reclaiming more deletes,
are favored.</p>
<p>If a merge will produce a segment that&#8217;s larger than
<code class="literal">max_merged_segment</code> then the policy will merge fewer segments (down to
1 at once, if that one has deletions) to keep the segment size under
budget.</p>
<p>Note, this can mean that for large shards that holds many gigabytes of
data, the default of <code class="literal">max_merged_segment</code> (<code class="literal">5gb</code>) can cause for many
segments to be in an index, and causing searches to be slower. Use the
indices segments API to see the segments that an index has, and
possibly either increase the <code class="literal">max_merged_segment</code> or issue an optimize
call for the index (try and aim to issue it on a low traffic time).</p>

<p>A merge policy that merges segments into levels of exponentially
increasing <span class="strong strong"><strong>byte size</strong></span>, where each level has fewer segments than the
value of the merge factor. Whenever extra segments (beyond the merge
factor upper bound) are encountered, all segments within the level are
merged.</p>

<p>The merge scheduler (ConcurrentMergeScheduler) controls the execution of
merge operations once they are needed (according to the merge policy).  Merges
run in separate threads, and when the maximum number of threads is reached,
further merges will wait until a merge thread becomes available.  The merge
scheduler supports this setting:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">index.merge.scheduler.max_thread_count</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The maximum number of threads that may be merging at once. Defaults to
<code class="literal">Math.max(1, Math.min(3, Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() / 2))</code>
which works well for a good solid-state-disk (SSD).  If your index is on
spinning platter drives instead, decrease this to 1.

<p>This is accepted for backwards compatibility, but just uses
ConcurrentMergeScheduler with index.merge.scheduler.max_thread_count
