<p>The <code class="literal">query</code> section contains detailed timing of the query tree executed by Lucene on a particular shard.
The overall structure of this query tree will resemble your original Elasticsearch query, but may be slightly
(or sometimes very) different.  It will also use similar but not always identical naming.  Using our previous
<code class="literal">term</code> query example, let&#8217;s analyze the <code class="literal">query</code> section:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">"query": [
    {
       "query_type": "BooleanQuery",
       "lucene": "message:search message:test",
       "time": "15.52889800ms",
       "breakdown": {...},               <a id="CO40-1"></a><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i>
       "children": [
          {
             "query_type": "TermQuery",
             "lucene": "message:search",
             "time": "4.938855000ms",
             "breakdown": {...}
          },
          {
             "query_type": "TermQuery",
             "lucene": "message:test",
             "time": "0.5016660000ms",
             "breakdown": {...}
          }
       ]
    }
]</pre>
</div>
<div class="calloutlist">
<table border="0" summary="Callout list">
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO40-1"><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i></a></p>
</td>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Based on the profile structure, we can see that our <code class="literal">match</code> query was rewritten by Lucene into a BooleanQuery with two
clauses (both holding a TermQuery).  The <code class="literal">"query_type"</code> field displays the Lucene class name, and often aligns with
the equivalent name in Elasticsearch.  The <code class="literal">"lucene"</code> field displays the Lucene explanation text for the query, and
is made available to help differentiating between parts of your query (e.g. both <code class="literal">"message:search"</code> and <code class="literal">"message:test"</code>
are TermQuery&#8217;s and would appear identical otherwise.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">"time"</code> field shows that this query took ~15ms for the entire BooleanQuery to execute.  The recorded time is inclusive
of all children.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">"breakdown"</code> field will give detailed stats about how the time was spent, we&#8217;ll look at
that in a moment.  Finally, the <code class="literal">"children"</code> array lists any sub-queries that may be present.  Because we searched for two
values ("search test"), our BooleanQuery holds two children TermQueries.  They have identical information (query_type, time,
breakdown, etc).  Children are allowed to have their own children.</p>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div>
<h3 class="title"><a id="_timing_breakdown"></a>Timing Breakdown<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/2.3/docs/reference/search/profile.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
</div></div></div>
<p>The <code class="literal">breakdown</code> component lists detailed timing statistics about low-level Lucene execution:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">"breakdown": {
  "score": 0,
  "next_doc": 24495,
  "match": 0,
  "create_weight": 8488388,
  "build_scorer": 7016015,
  "advance": 0

}</pre>
</div>
<p>Timings are listed in wall-clock nanoseconds and are not normalized at all.  All caveats about the overall
<code class="literal">time</code> apply here.  The intention of the breakdown is to give you a feel for A) what machinery in Lucene is
actually eating time, and B) the magnitude of differences in times between the various components.  Like the overall time,
the breakdown is inclusive of all children times.</p>
<p>The meaning of the stats are as follows:</p>
<h3><a id="_all_parameters_3"></a>All parameters:<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/2.3/docs/reference/search/profile.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>

<td valign="top">
<p>
A Query in Lucene must be capable of reuse across multiple IndexSearchers (think of it as the engine that
executes a search against a specific Lucene Index).  This puts Lucene in a tricky spot, since many queries
need to accumulate temporary state/statistics associated with the index it is being used against, but the
Query contract mandates that it must be immutable.
<br>
<br>
To get around this, Lucene asks each query to generate a Weight object which acts as a temporary context
object to hold state associated with this particular (IndexSearcher, Query) tuple.  The <code class="literal">weight</code> metric
shows how long this process takes

<p>
<code class="literal">build_scorer</code>
</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<p>
This parameter shows how long it takes to build a Scorer for the query.  A Scorer is the mechanism that
iterates over matching documents generates a score per-document (e.g. how well does "foo" match the document?).
Note, this records the time required to generate the Scorer object, not actually score the documents.  Some
queries have faster or slower initialization of the Scorer, depending on optimizations, complexity, etc.
<br>
<br>
This may also showing timing associated with caching, if enabled and/or applicable for the query

<p>
<code class="literal">next_doc</code>
</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<p>
The Lucene method <code class="literal">next_doc</code> returns Doc ID of the next document matching the query.  This statistic shows
the time it takes to determine which document is the next match, a process that varies considerably depending
on the nature of the query.   Next_doc is a specialized form of advance() which is more convenient for many
queries in Lucene.  It is equivalent to advance(docId() + 1)
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<p>
<code class="literal">advance</code>
</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<p>
<code class="literal">advance</code> is the "lower level" version of next_doc: it serves the same purpose of finding the next matching
doc, but requires the calling query to perform extra tasks such as identifying and moving past skips, etc.
However,  not all queries can use next_doc, so <code class="literal">advance</code> is also timed for those queries.
<br>
<br>
Conjunctions (e.g. <code class="literal">must</code> clauses in a boolean) are typical consumers of <code class="literal">advance</code>
</p>

<td valign="top">
<p>
<code class="literal">matches</code>
</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<p>
Some queries, such as phrase queries, match documents using a "Two Phase" process.  First, the document is
"approximately" matched, and if it matches approximately, it is checked a second time with a more rigorous
(and expensive) process.  The second phase verification is what the <code class="literal">matches</code> statistic measures.
<br>
<br>
For example, a phrase query first checks a document approximately by ensuring all terms in the phrase are
present in the doc.  If all the terms are present, it then executes the second phase verification to ensure
the terms are in-order to form the phrase, which is relatively more expensive than just checking for presence
of the terms.
<br>
<br>
Because this two-phase process is only used by a handful of queries, the <code class="literal">metric</code> statistic will often be zero
