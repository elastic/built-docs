<p>Collectively, we have a lot of experience with users suffering
unexpected issues because they have not configured
<a class="xref" href="important-settings.html" title="Important Elasticsearch configuration">important settings</a>. In previous versions of
Elasticsearch, misconfiguration of some of these settings were logged
as warnings. Understandably, users sometimes miss these log messages.
To ensure that these settings receive the attention that they deserve,
Elasticsearch has bootstrap checks upon startup.</p>
<p>These bootstrap checks inspect a variety of Elasticsearch and system
settings and compare them to values that are safe for the operation of
Elasticsearch. If Elasticsearch is in development mode, any bootstrap
checks that fail appear as warnings in the Elasticsearch log. If
Elasticsearch is in production mode, any bootstrap checks that fail will
cause Elasticsearch to refuse to start.</p>
<p>There are some bootstrap checks that are always enforced to prevent
Elasticsearch from running with incompatible settings. These checks are
documented individually.</p>

<p>By default, Elasticsearch binds to <code class="literal">localhost</code> for <a class="xref" href="modules-http.html" title="HTTP">HTTP</a>
and <a class="xref" href="modules-transport.html" title="Transport">transport (internal)</a> communication. This is
fine for downloading and playing with Elasticsearch, and everyday
development but it&#8217;s useless for production systems. To form a cluster,
Elasticsearch instances must be reachable via transport communication so
they must bind transport to an external interface. Thus, we consider an
Elasticsearch instance to be in development mode if it does not bind
transport to an external interface (the default), and is otherwise in
production mode if it does bind transport to an external interface. Note
that HTTP can be configured independently of transport via
<a class="xref" href="modules-http.html" title="HTTP"><code class="literal">http.host</code></a> and <a class="xref" href="modules-transport.html" title="Transport"><code class="literal">transport.host</code></a>;
this can be useful for configuring a single instance to be reachable via
HTTP for testing purposes without triggering production mode.</p>
