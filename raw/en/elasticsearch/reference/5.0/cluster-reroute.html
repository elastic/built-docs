<p>The reroute command allows to explicitly execute a cluster reroute
allocation command including specific commands. For example, a shard can
be moved from one node to another explicitly, an allocation can be
canceled, or an unassigned shard can be explicitly allocated on a
specific node.</p>
<p>Here is a short example of how a simple reroute API call:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_cluster/reroute' -d '{
    "commands" : [ {
        "move" :
            {
              "index" : "test", "shard" : 0,
              "from_node" : "node1", "to_node" : "node2"
            }
        },
        {
          "allocate_replica" : {
              "index" : "test", "shard" : 1, "node" : "node3"
          }
        }
    ]
}'</pre>
</div>
<p>An important aspect to remember is the fact that once when an allocation
occurs, the cluster will aim at re-balancing its state back to an even
state. For example, if the allocation includes moving a shard from
<code class="literal">node1</code> to <code class="literal">node2</code>, in an <code class="literal">even</code> state, then another shard will be moved
from <code class="literal">node2</code> to <code class="literal">node1</code> to even things out.</p>
<p>The cluster can be set to disable allocations, which means that only the
explicitly allocations will be performed. Obviously, only once all
commands has been applied, the cluster will aim to be re-balance its
state.</p>
<p>Another option is to run the commands in <code class="literal">dry_run</code> (as a URI flag, or in
the request body). This will cause the commands to apply to the current
cluster state, and return the resulting cluster after the commands (and
re-balancing) has been applied.</p>
<p>If the <code class="literal">explain</code> parameter is specified, a detailed explanation of why the
commands could or could not be executed is returned.</p>
<p>The commands supported are:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">move</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Move a started shard from one node to another node. Accepts
<code class="literal">index</code> and <code class="literal">shard</code> for index name and shard number, <code class="literal">from_node</code> for the
node to move the shard <code class="literal">from</code>, and <code class="literal">to_node</code> for the node to move the
shard to.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cancel</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Cancel allocation of a shard (or recovery). Accepts <code class="literal">index</code>
and <code class="literal">shard</code> for index name and shard number, and <code class="literal">node</code> for the node to
cancel the shard allocation on. It also accepts <code class="literal">allow_primary</code> flag to
explicitly specify that it is allowed to cancel allocation for a primary
shard.  This can be used to force resynchronization of existing replicas
from the primary shard by cancelling them and allowing them to be
reinitialized through the standard reallocation process.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">allocate_replica</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Allocate an unassigned replica shard to a node. Accepts the
<code class="literal">index</code> and <code class="literal">shard</code> for index name and shard number, and <code class="literal">node</code> to
allocate the shard to. Takes <a class="xref" href="modules-cluster.html" title="Cluster">allocation deciders</a> into account.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Two more commands are available that allow the allocation of a primary shard
to a node. These commands should however be used with extreme care, as primary
shard allocation is usually fully automatically handled by Elasticsearch.
Reasons why a primary shard cannot be automatically allocated include the following:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
A new index was created but there is no node which satisfies the allocation deciders.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
An up-to-date shard copy of the data cannot be found on the current data nodes in
the cluster. To prevent data loss, the system does not automatically promote a stale
shard copy to primary.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As a manual override, two commands to forcefully allocate primary shards
are available:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">allocate_stale_primary</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Allocate a primary shard to a node that holds a stale copy. Accepts the
<code class="literal">index</code> and <code class="literal">shard</code> for index name and shard number, and <code class="literal">node</code> to
allocate the shard to. Using this command may lead to data loss
for the provided shard id. If a node which has the good copy of the
data rejoins the cluster later on, that data will be overwritten with
the data of the stale copy that was forcefully allocated with this
command. To ensure that these implications are well-understood,
this command requires the special field <code class="literal">accept_data_loss</code> to be
explicitly set to <code class="literal">true</code> for it to work.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">allocate_empty_primary</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Allocate an empty primary shard to a node. Accepts the
<code class="literal">index</code> and <code class="literal">shard</code> for index name and shard number, and <code class="literal">node</code> to
allocate the shard to. Using this command leads to a complete loss
of all data that was indexed into this shard, if it was previously
started. If a node which has a copy of the
data rejoins the cluster later on, that data will be deleted!
To ensure that these implications are well-understood,
this command requires the special field <code class="literal">accept_data_loss</code> to be
explicitly set to <code class="literal">true</code> for it to work.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="_retry_failed_shards"></a>Retry failed shards</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/5.0/docs/reference/cluster/reroute.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>The cluster will attempt to allocate a shard a maximum of
<code class="literal">index.allocation.max_retries</code> times in a row (defaults to <code class="literal">5</code>), before giving
up and leaving the shard unallocated. This scenario can be caused by
structural problems such as having an analyzer which refers to a stopwords
file which doesn&#8217;t exist on all nodes.</p>
<p>Once the problem has been corrected, allocation can be manually retried by
calling the <a class="xref" href="cluster-reroute.html" title="Cluster Reroute"><code class="literal">_reroute</code></a> API with <code class="literal">?retry_failed</code>, which
will attempt a single retry round for these shards.</p>
