<p>Elasticsearch requires a full cluster restart when upgrading across major
versions.  Rolling upgrades are not supported across major versions. Consult
this <a class="xref" href="setup-upgrade.html" title="Upgrading Elasticsearch">table</a> to verify that a full cluster restart is
required.</p>
<p>The process to perform an upgrade with a full cluster restart is as follows:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Disable shard allocation</strong></span></p>
<p>When you shut down a node, the allocation process will immediately try to
replicate the shards that were on that node to other nodes in the cluster,
causing a lot of wasted I/O.  This can be avoided by disabling allocation
before shutting down a node:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "none"
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/53.console"></div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Perform a synced flush</strong></span></p>
<p>Shard recovery will be much faster if you stop indexing and issue a
<a class="xref" href="indices-synced-flush.html" title="Synced Flush">synced-flush</a> request:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">POST _flush/synced</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/54.console"></div>
<p>A synced flush request is a &#8220;best effort&#8221; operation. It will fail if there
are any pending indexing operations, but it is safe to reissue the request
multiple times if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Shutdown and upgrade all nodes</strong></span></p>
<p>Stop all Elasticsearch services on all nodes in the cluster. Each node can be
upgraded following the same procedure described in <a class="xref" href="rolling-upgrades.html#upgrade-node">Stop and upgrade a single node</a>.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Upgrade any plugins</strong></span></p>
<p>Elasticsearch plugins must be upgraded when upgrading a node.  Use the
<code class="literal">elasticsearch-plugin</code> script to install the correct version of any plugins
that you need.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Start the cluster</strong></span></p>
<p>If you have dedicated master nodes&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;nodes with <code class="literal">node.master</code> set to
<code class="literal">true</code>(the default) and <code class="literal">node.data</code> set to <code class="literal">false</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201; then it is a good idea
to start them first.  Wait for them to form a cluster and to elect a master
before proceeding with the data nodes. You can check progress by looking at the
logs.</p>
<p>As soon as the <a class="xref" href="modules-discovery-zen.html#master-election" title="Master Election">minimum number of master-eligible nodes</a>
have discovered each other, they will form a cluster and elect a master.  From
that point on, the <a class="xref" href="cat-health.html" title="cat health"><code class="literal">_cat/health</code></a> and <a class="xref" href="cat-nodes.html" title="cat nodes"><code class="literal">_cat/nodes</code></a>
APIs can be used to monitor nodes joining the cluster:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET _cat/health

GET _cat/nodes</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/55.console"></div>
<p>Use these APIs to check that all nodes have successfully joined the cluster.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Wait for yellow</strong></span></p>
<p>As soon as each node has joined the cluster, it will start to recover any
primary shards that are stored locally.  Initially, the
<a class="xref" href="cat-health.html" title="cat health"><code class="literal">_cat/health</code></a> request will report a <code class="literal">status</code> of <code class="literal">red</code>, meaning
that not all primary shards have been allocated.</p>
<p>Once each node has recovered its local shards, the <code class="literal">status</code> will become
<code class="literal">yellow</code>, meaning all primary shards have been recovered, but not all replica
shards are allocated.  This is to be expected because allocation is still
disabled.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Reenable allocation</strong></span></p>
<p>Delaying the allocation of replicas until all nodes have joined the cluster
allows the master to allocate replicas to nodes which already have local shard
copies.   At this point, with all the nodes in the cluster, it is safe to
reenable shard allocation:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "all"
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/56.console"></div>
<p>The cluster will now start allocating replica shards to all data nodes. At this
point it is safe to resume indexing and searching, but your cluster will
recover more quickly if you can delay indexing and searching until all shards
have recovered.</p>
<p>You can monitor progress with the <a class="xref" href="cat-health.html" title="cat health"><code class="literal">_cat/health</code></a> and
<a class="xref" href="cat-recovery.html" title="cat recovery"><code class="literal">_cat/recovery</code></a> APIs:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET _cat/health

GET _cat/recovery</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/57.console"></div>
<p>Once the <code class="literal">status</code> column in the <code class="literal">_cat/health</code> output has reached <code class="literal">green</code>, all
primary and replica shards have been successfully allocated.</p>
