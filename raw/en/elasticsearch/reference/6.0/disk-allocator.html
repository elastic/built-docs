<p>Elasticsearch considers the available disk space on a node before deciding
whether to allocate new shards to that node or to actively relocate shards away
from that node.</p>
<p>Below are the settings that can be configured in the <code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code> config
file or updated dynamically on a live cluster with the
<a class="xref" href="cluster-update-settings.html" title="Cluster Update Settings">cluster-update-settings</a> API:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Defaults to <code class="literal">true</code>.  Set to <code class="literal">false</code> to disable the disk allocation decider.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Controls the low watermark for disk usage. It defaults to <code class="literal">85%</code>, meaning
that Elasticsearch will not allocate shards to nodes that have more than
85% disk used. It can also be set to an absolute byte value (like <code class="literal">500mb</code>)
to prevent Elasticsearch from allocating shards if less than the specified
amount of space is available. This setting has no effect on the primary
shards of newly-created indices or, specifically, any shards that have
never previously been allocated.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Controls the high watermark. It defaults to <code class="literal">90%</code>, meaning that
Elasticsearch will attempt to relocate shards away from a node whose disk
usage is above 90%. It can also be set to an absolute byte value (similarly
to the low watermark) to relocate shards away from a node if it has less
than the specified amount of free space. This setting affects the
allocation of all shards, whether previously allocated or not.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.flood_stage</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Controls the flood stage watermark. It defaults to 95%, meaning that
Elasticsearch enforces a read-only index block
(<code class="literal">index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete</code>) on every index that has one or more
shards allocated on the node that has at least one disk exceeding the flood
stage. This is a last resort to prevent nodes from running out of disk space.
The index block must be released manually once there is enough disk space
available to allow indexing operations to continue.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>You can not mix the usage of percentage values and byte values within
these settings. Either all are set to percentage values, or all are set to byte
values. This is so that we can we validate that the settings are internally
consistent (that is, the low disk threshold is not more than the high disk
threshold, and the high disk threshold is not more than the flood stage
threshold).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>An example of resetting the read-only index block on the <code class="literal">twitter</code> index:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT /twitter/_settings
{
  "index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": null
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1127.console"></div>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cluster.info.update.interval</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
How often Elasticsearch should check on disk usage for each node in the
cluster. Defaults to <code class="literal">30s</code>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cluster.routing.allocation.disk.include_relocations</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Defaults to <code class="literal">true</code>, which means that Elasticsearch will take into account
shards that are currently being relocated to the target node when computing
a node&#8217;s disk usage. Taking relocating shards' sizes into account may,
however, mean that the disk usage for a node is incorrectly estimated on
the high side, since the relocation could be 90% complete and a recently
retrieved disk usage would include the total size of the relocating shard
as well as the space already used by the running relocation.
</dd>
</dl>

<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Percentage values refer to used disk space, while byte values refer to
free disk space. This can be confusing, since it flips the meaning of high and
low. For example, it makes sense to set the low watermark to 10gb and the high
watermark to 5gb, but not the other way around.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>An example of updating the low watermark to at least 100 gigabytes free, a high
watermark of at least 50 gigabytes free, and a flood stage watermark of 10
gigabytes free, and updating the information about the cluster every minute:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "transient": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low": "100gb",
    "cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high": "50gb",
    "cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.flood_stage": "10gb",
    "cluster.info.update.interval": "1m"
