<p>Elasticsearch is at the core of the X-Pack monitoring. In all cases, X-Pack monitoring documents
are just ordinary JSON documents built by monitoring each Elastic Stack
component at some polling interval (<code class="literal">10s</code> by default), then indexing those
documents into the monitoring cluster. Each component in the stack is
responsible for monitoring itself and then forwarding those documents to Elasticsearch
for both routing and indexing (storage).</p>
<p>For Elasticsearch, this process is handled by what are called <em>collectors</em> and
<em>exporters</em>. In the past, collectors and exporters were considered to be part of
a monitoring "agent", but that term is generally not used anymore.</p>
<p>Each collector runs once for each collection interval to obtain data from the
public APIs in Elasticsearch and X-Pack that it chooses to monitor. When the data
collection is finished, the data is handed in bulk to the exporters to be sent
to the monitoring clusters.</p>
<p>X-Pack monitoring in Elasticsearch also receives monitoring data from other parts of the
Elastic Stack. In this way, it serves as an unscheduled monitoring data
collector for the stack. Once data is received, it is forwarded to the exporters
to be routed to the monitoring cluster like all monitoring data.</p>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Because this stack-level "collector" lives outside of the collection
interval of X-Pack monitoring for Elasticsearch, it is not impacted by the
<code class="literal">xpack.monitoring.collection.interval</code> setting. Therefore, data is passed to the
exporters whenever it is received. This behavior can result in indices for Kibana,
Logstash, or Beats being created somewhat unexpectedly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>While the monitoring data is collected and processed, some production cluster
metadata is added to incoming documents. This metadata enables Kibana to link the
monitoring data to the appropriate cluster.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If this linkage is unimportant to the infrastructure that you&#8217;re
monitoring, it might be simpler to configure Logstash to report its monitoring
data directly to the monitoring cluster. This scenario also prevents the
production cluster from adding extra overhead related to monitoring data, which
can be very useful when there are a large number of Logstash nodes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Regardless of the number of exporters, each collector only runs once per
monitoring interval.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>It is possible to configure more than one exporter, but the general and
default setup is to use a single exporter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are two types of exporters in Elasticsearch: <code class="literal">local</code> and <code class="literal">http</code>. It is the
responsibility of the exporters to send documents to the monitoring cluster
that they communicate with. How that happens depends on the exporter, but the
end result is the same: documents are indexed in what the exporter deems to be
the monitoring cluster.</p>
<p>Before X-Pack monitoring can actually be used, it is necessary for it to set up
certain Elasticsearch resources. These include templates and ingest pipelines. Exporters
handle the setup of these resources before ever sending data. If resource setup
fails (for example, due to security permissions), no data is sent and
warnings are logged.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>It is critical that all Elasticsearch nodes have their exporters configured in
the same way. If they do not, some monitoring data might be missing from the
monitoring cluster.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>All settings associated with X-Pack monitoring in Elasticsearch must be set in either the
<code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code> file for each node or, where possible, in the dynamic
cluster settings. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="monitoring-settings.html" title="Monitoring Settings in Elasticsearch">Monitoring Settings</a>.</p>
