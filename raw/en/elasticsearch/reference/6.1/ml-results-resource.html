<p>Several different result types are created for each job. You can query anomaly
results for <em>buckets</em>, <em>influencers</em>, and <em>records</em> by using the results API.
Summarized bucket results over multiple jobs can be queried as well; those
results are called <em>overall buckets</em>.</p>
<p>Results are written for each <code class="literal">bucket_span</code>. The timestamp for the results is the
start of the bucket time interval.</p>
<p>The results include scores, which are calculated for each anomaly result type and
each bucket interval. These scores are aggregated in order to reduce noise, and
normalized in order to identify and rank the most mathematically significant
anomalies.</p>
<p>Bucket results provide the top level, overall view of the job and are ideal for
alerts. For example, the bucket results might indicate that at 16:05 the system
was unusual. This information is a summary of all the anomalies, pinpointing
when they occurred.</p>
<p>Influencer results show which entities were anomalous and when. For example,
the influencer results might indicate that at 16:05 <code class="literal">user_name: Bob</code> was unusual.
This information is a summary of all the anomalies for each entity, so there
can be a lot of these results. Once you have identified a notable bucket time,
you can look to see which entities were significant.</p>
<p>Record results provide details about what the individual anomaly was, when it
occurred and which entity was involved. For example, the record results might
indicate that at 16:05 Bob sent 837262434 bytes, when the typical value was
1067 bytes. Once you have identified a bucket time and perhaps a significant
entity too, you can drill through to the record results in order to investigate
the anomalous behavior.</p>
<p>Categorization results contain the definitions of <em>categories</em> that have been
identified. These are only applicable for jobs that are configured to analyze
unstructured log data using categorization. These results do not contain a
timestamp or any calculated scores. For more information, see
<a href="/guide/en/x-pack/6.1/ml-configuring-categories.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Categorizing Log Messages</a>.</p>

<h4><a id="ml-results-buckets"></a>Buckets</h4>
<p>Bucket results provide the top level, overall view of the job and are best for
alerting.</p>
<p>Each bucket has an <code class="literal">anomaly_score</code>, which is a statistically aggregated and
normalized view of the combined anomalousness of all the record results within
each bucket.</p>
<p>One bucket result is written for each <code class="literal">bucket_span</code> for each job, even if it is
not considered to be anomalous. If the bucket is not anomalous, it has an
<code class="literal">anomaly_score</code> of zero.</p>
<p>When you identify an anomalous bucket, you can investigate further by expanding
the bucket resource to show the records as nested objects. Alternatively, you
can access the records resource directly and filter by the date range.</p>

<h4><a id="ml-results-influencers"></a>Influencers</h4>
<p>Influencers are the entities that have contributed to, or are to blame for,
the anomalies. Influencer results are available only if an
<code class="literal">influencer_field_name</code> is specified in the job configuration.</p>
<p>Influencers are given an <code class="literal">influencer_score</code>, which is calculated based on the
anomalies that have occurred in each bucket interval. For jobs with more than
one detector, this gives a powerful view of the most anomalous entities.</p>
<p>For example, if you are analyzing unusual bytes sent and unusual domains
visited and you specified <code class="literal">user_name</code> as the influencer, then an
<code class="literal">influencer_score</code> for each anomalous user name is written per bucket. For
example, if <code class="literal">user_name: Bob</code> had an <code class="literal">influencer_score</code> greater than 75, then
<code class="literal">Bob</code> would be considered very anomalous during this time interval in one or
both of those areas (unusual bytes sent or unusual domains visited).</p>
<p>One influencer result is written per bucket for each influencer that is
considered anomalous.</p>
<p>When you identify an influencer with a high score, you can investigate further
by accessing the records resource for that bucket and enumerating the anomaly
records that contain the influencer.</p>
<p>An influencer object has the following properties:</p>
<div class="variablelist">

<p>Additional influencer properties are added, depending on the fields being

</div>
</div>
<h4><a id="ml-results-records"></a>Records</h4>
<p>Records contain the detailed analytical results. They describe the anomalous
activity that has been identified in the input data based on the detector
configuration.</p>
<p>For example, if you are looking for unusually large data transfers, an anomaly
record can identify the source IP address, the destination, the time window
during which it occurred, the expected and actual size of the transfer, and the
probability of this occurrence.</p>
<p>There can be many anomaly records depending on the characteristics and size of
the input data. In practice, there are often too many to be able to manually
process them. The X-Pack machine learning features therefore perform a sophisticated
aggregation of the anomaly records into buckets.</p>
<p>The number of record results depends on the number of anomalies found in each
bucket, which relates to the number of time series being modeled and the number of
detectors.</p>

<h4><a id="ml-results-overall-buckets"></a>Overall Buckets</h4>
<p>Overall buckets provide a summary of bucket results over multiple jobs.
Their <code class="literal">bucket_span</code> equals the longest <code class="literal">bucket_span</code> of the jobs in question.
The <code class="literal">overall_score</code> is the <code class="literal">top_n</code> average of the max <code class="literal">anomaly_score</code> per job
within the overall bucket time interval.
This means that you can fine-tune the <code class="literal">overall_score</code> so that it is more
or less sensitive to the number of jobs that detect an anomaly at the same time.</p>
<p>An overall bucket resource has the following properties:</p>
