<p>There is an issue with doc counts, related to the above grouping limitation.  Imagine you have two Rollup jobs saving to the same index, where
one job is a "subset" of another job.</p>
<p>For example, you might have jobs with these two groupings:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">PUT _xpack/rollup/job/sensor-all
{
    "groups" : {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field": "timestamp",
        "interval": "1h",
        "delay": "7d"
      },
      "terms": {
        "fields": ["node"]
      }
    },
    "metrics": [
        {
            "field": "price",
            "metrics": ["avg"]
        }
    ]
    ...
}</pre>
</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">PUT _xpack/rollup/job/sensor-building
{
    "groups" : {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field": "timestamp",
        "interval": "1h",
        "delay": "7d"
      },
      "terms": {
        "fields": ["node", "building"]
      }
    }
    ...
}</pre>
</div>
<p>The first job <code class="literal">sensor-all</code> contains the groupings and metrics that apply to all data in the index.  The second job is rolling up a subset
of data (in different buildings) which also include a building identifier.  You did this because combining them would run into the limitation
described in the previous section.</p>
<p>This <em>mostly</em> works, but can sometimes return incorrect <code class="literal">doc_counts</code> when you search.  All metrics will be valid however.</p>
<p>The issue arises from the composite agg limitation described before, combined with search-time optimization.  Imagine you try to run the
following aggregation:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">"aggs" : {
  "nodes": {
    "terms": {
      "field": "node"
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>This aggregation could be serviced by either <code class="literal">sensor-all</code> or <code class="literal">sensor-building</code> job, since they both group on the node field.  So the RollupSearch
API will search both of them and merge results.  This will result in <span class="strong strong"><strong>correct</strong></span> doc_counts and <span class="strong strong"><strong>correct</strong></span> metrics.  No problem here.</p>
<p>The issue arises from an aggregation that can <em>only</em> be serviced by <code class="literal">sensor-building</code>, like this one:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">"aggs" : {
  "nodes": {
    "terms": {
      "field": "node"
    },
    "aggs": {
      "building": {
        "terms": {
          "field": "building"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>Now we run into a problem.  The RollupSearch API will correctly identify that only <code class="literal">sensor-building</code> job has all the required components
to answer the aggregation, and will search it exclusively.  Unfortunately, due to the composite aggregation limitation, that job only
rolled up documents that have both a "node" and a "building" field.  Meaning that the doc_counts for the <code class="literal">"nodes"</code> aggregation will not
include counts for any document that doesn&#8217;t have <code class="literal">[node, building]</code> fields.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The <code class="literal">doc_count</code> for <code class="literal">"nodes"</code> aggregation will be incorrect because it only contains counts for <code class="literal">nodes</code> that also have buildings
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The <code class="literal">doc_count</code> for <code class="literal">"buildings"</code> aggregation will be correct
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Any metrics, on any level, will be correct
</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div></div></div>
<p>There are two main workarounds if you find yourself with a schema like the above.</p>
<p>Easiest and most robust method: use separate indices to store your rollups.  The limitations arise because you have several document
schemas co-habitating in a single index, which makes it difficult for rollups to correctly summarize.  If you make several rollup
jobs and store them in separate indices, these sorts of difficulties do not arise.  It does, however, keep you from searching across several
different rollup indices at the same time.</p>
<p>The other workaround is to include an "off-target" aggregation in the query, which pulls in the "superset" job and corrects the doc counts.
The RollupSearch API determines the best job to search for each "leaf node" in the aggregation tree.  So if we include a metric agg on <code class="literal">price</code>,
which was only defined in the <code class="literal">sensor-all</code> job, that will "pull in" the other job:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">"aggs" : {
  "nodes": {
    "terms": {
      "field": "node"
    },
    "aggs": {
      "building": {
        "terms": {
          "field": "building"
        }
      },
      "avg_price": {
        "avg": { "field": "price" } <a id="CO361-1"></a><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i>
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="calloutlist">
<table border="0" summary="Callout list">
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO361-1"><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i></a></p>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>Adding an avg aggregation here will fix the doc counts</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Because only <code class="literal">sensor-all</code> job had an <code class="literal">avg</code> on the price field, the RollupSearch API is forced to pull in that additional job for searching,
and will merge/correct the doc_counts as appropriate.  This sort of workaround applies to any additional aggregation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;metric or bucketing&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;although it can be tedious to look through the jobs and determine the right one to add.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>We realize this is an onerous limitation, and somewhat breaks the rollup contract of "pick the fields to rollup, we do the rest".  We are
actively working to get the limitation to <code class="literal">composite</code> agg fixed, and the related issues in Rollup.  The documentation will be updated when
the fix is implemented.</p>
