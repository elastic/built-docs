<p>We want your feedback on the experimental features in this release! Let
us know what you’d like to see next and any problems you encounter.</p>

<h3><a id="_license_management_and_x_pack_code"></a>License management and X-Pack code<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.4/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-6.3.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Starting with version 6.3, the default distribution of Elasticsearch contains open source
and free commercial features and access to paid commercial features. You no
longer need to install X-Pack as a separate step. When you install Elasticsearch, it
generates a basic license with no expiration date. All the free commercial
features are enabled by default and will never expire.</p>
<p>You can view the status of your license, update your license, or start a 30-day
trial of platinum features by using the <a class="xref" href="licensing-apis.html" title="Licensing APIs"><em>Licensing APIs</em></a> or Kibana. The trial
enables you to try out features such as security, machine learning, alerting,
graph capabilities, and more.</p>
<p>For more information about licenses, see <a href="/subscriptions" class="ulink" target="_top">https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions</a></p>
<h3><a id="_sql"></a>SQL<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.4/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-6.3.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>This experimental feature enables users who are familiar with SQL to
use SQL statements to query Elasticsearch indices. In addition to querying
through the SQL API, you can use the Translate API to see how SQL queries
are translated to native Elasticsearch queries.</p>
<p>The included SQL CLI provides a simple way to submit SQL queries to Elasticsearch.
Similarly, the Elasticsearch JDBC driver enables you to connect your favorite
JDBC-compatible tool to Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a class="xref" href="xpack-sql.html" title="SQL Access">SQL Access</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_rollups"></a>Rollups<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.4/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-6.3.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>This experimental feature enables you to summarize and store historical data
so that is still available for analysis, but consumes significantly less
storage space. This is particularly useful when you&#8217;re working with monitoring
and metrics data where it&#8217;s not feasible to retain the raw data indefinitely.</p>
<p>When you ask Elasticsearch to store a rollup of data, it also stores the underlying
statistics. For example, if you roll up an average, the sum and count are also
stored so that the average can be recomputed at query time. This enables you to
query both rolled up data and “live” data simultaneously using the standard
query DSL.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a class="xref" href="xpack-rollup.html" title="Rolling up historical data">Rolling up historical data</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_java_10_support"></a>Java 10 Support<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.4/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-6.3.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Java 9 was a short-term release that reached EOL in March 2018. 6.3.0 introduces
support for Java 10, which is scheduled to reach EOL in September 2018.</p>
<p>If you are not comfortable with the rapid release cycle of Java short term
versions (and EOL dates), you can continue to use Java 8. See the
<a href="/support/matrix#matrix_jvm" class="ulink" target="_top">support matrix</a>
for all of the JVM options for Elasticsearch.</p>
