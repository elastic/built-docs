<p>Cross-cluster replication is done on an index-by-index basis. Replication is
configured at the index level. For each configured replication there is a
replication source index called the <em>leader index</em> and a replication target
index called the <em>follower index</em>.</p>
<p>Replication is active-passive. This means that while the leader index
can directly be written into, the follower index can not directly receive
writes.</p>
<p>Replication is pull-based. This means that replication is driven by the
follower index. This simplifies state management on the leader index and means
that cross-cluster replication does not interfere with indexing on the leader index.</p>

<h4><a id="_the_mechanics_of_replication"></a>The mechanics of replication<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.5/docs/reference/ccr/overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>While replication is managed at the index level, replication is performed at the
shard level. When a follower index is created, it is automatically
configured to have an identical number of shards as the leader index. A follower
shard task in the follower index pulls from the corresponding leader shard in
the leader index by sending read requests for new operations. These read
requests can be served from any copy of the leader shard (primary or replicas).</p>
<p>For each read request sent by the follower shard task, if there are new
operations available on the leader shard, the leader shard responds with
operations limited by the read parameters that you established when you
configured the follower index. If there are no new operations available on the
leader shard, the leader shard waits up to a configured timeout for new
operations. If new operations occur within that timeout, the leader shard
immediately responds with those new operations. Otherwise, if the timeout
elapses, the follower shard replies that there are no new operations. The
follower shard task updates some statistics and immediately sends another read
request to the leader shard. This ensures that the network connections between
the remote cluster and the local cluster are continually being used so as to
avoid forceful termination by an external source (such as a firewall).</p>
<p>If a read request fails, the cause of the failure is inspected. If the
cause of the failure is deemed to be a failure that can be recovered from (for
example, a network failure), the follower shard task enters into a retry
loop. Otherwise, the follower shard task is paused and requires user
intervention before the it can be resumed with the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/ccr-post-resume-follow.html" class="ulink" target="_top">resume follower API</a>.</p>
<p>When operations are received by the follower shard task, they are placed in a
write buffer. The follower shard task manages this write buffer and submits
bulk write requests from this write buffer to the follower shard.  The write
buffer and these write requests are managed by the write parameters that you
established when you configured the follower index.  The write buffer serves as
back-pressure against read requests. If the write buffer exceeds its configured
limits, no additional read requests are sent by the follower shard task. The
follower shard task resumes sending read requests when the write buffer no
longer exceeds its configured limits.</p>
<p>Mapping updates applied to the leader index are automatically retrieved
as-needed by the follower index.</p>
<p>Settings updates applied to the leader index that are needed by the follower
index are automatically retried as-needed by the follower index. Not all
settings updates are needed by the follower index. For example, changing the
number of replicas on the leader index is not replicated by the follower index.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If you apply a non-dynamic settings change to the leader index that is
needed by the follower index, the follower index will go through a cycle of
closing itself, applying the settings update, and then re-opening itself. The
follower index will be unavailable for reads and not replicating writes
during this cycle.</p>

<h4><a id="_inspecting_the_progress_of_replication"></a>Inspecting the progress of replication<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.5/docs/reference/ccr/overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>You can inspect the progress of replication at the shard level with the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/ccr-get-follow-stats.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get follower stats API</a>. This API gives you
insight into the read and writes managed by the follower shard task. It also
reports read exceptions that can be retried and fatal exceptions that require
user intervention.</p>
<h4><a id="_pausing_and_resuming_replication"></a>Pausing and resuming replication<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.5/docs/reference/ccr/overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>You can pause replication with the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/ccr-post-pause-follow.html" class="ulink" target="_top">pause follower API</a> and then later resume
replication with the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/ccr-post-resume-follow.html" class="ulink" target="_top">resume follower API</a>.
Using these APIs in tandem enables you to adjust the read and write parameters
on the follower shard task if your initial configuration is not suitable for
your use case.</p>

<p>You can terminate replication with the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/ccr-post-unfollow.html" class="ulink" target="_top">unfollow API</a>. This API converts a follower index
to a regular (non-follower) index.</p>
