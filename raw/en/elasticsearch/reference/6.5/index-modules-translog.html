<p>Changes to Lucene are only persisted to disk during a Lucene commit, which is a
relatively expensive operation and so cannot be performed after every index or
delete operation. Changes that happen after one commit and before another will
be removed from the index by Lucene in the event of process exit or hardware
failure.</p>
<p>Because Lucene commits are too expensive to perform on every individual change,
each shard copy also has a <em>transaction log</em> known as its <em>translog</em> associated
with it. All index and delete operations are written to the translog after
being processed by the internal Lucene index but before they are acknowledged.
In the event of a crash, recent transactions that have been acknowledged but
not yet included in the last Lucene commit can instead be recovered from the
translog when the shard recovers.</p>
<p>An Elasticsearch flush is the process of performing a Lucene commit and
starting a new translog. Flushes are performed automatically in the background
in order to make sure the translog doesn&#8217;t grow too large, which would make
replaying its operations take a considerable amount of time during recovery.
The ability to perform a flush manually is also exposed through an API,
although this is rarely needed.</p>
<h3><a id="_translog_settings"></a>Translog settings<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.5/docs/reference/index-modules/translog.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The data in the translog is only persisted to disk when the translog is
<code class="literal">fsync</code>ed and committed.  In the event of hardware failure, any data written
since the previous translog commit will be lost.</p>
<p>By default, Elasticsearch <code class="literal">fsync</code>s and commits the translog every 5 seconds
if <code class="literal">index.translog.durability</code> is set to <code class="literal">async</code> or if set to <code class="literal">request</code>
(default) at the end of every <a class="xref" href="docs-index_.html" title="Index API">index</a>, <a class="xref" href="docs-delete.html" title="Delete API">delete</a>,
<a class="xref" href="docs-update.html" title="Update API">update</a>, or  <a class="xref" href="docs-bulk.html" title="Bulk API">bulk</a> request. More precisely, if set
to <code class="literal">request</code>, Elasticsearch will only report success of an index, delete,
update, or bulk request to the client after the translog has been successfully
<code class="literal">fsync</code>ed and committed on the primary and on every allocated replica.</p>
<p>The following <a class="xref" href="indices-update-settings.html" title="Update Indices Settings">dynamically updatable</a> per-index
settings control the behaviour of the translog:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">index.translog.sync_interval</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
How often the translog is <code class="literal">fsync</code>ed to disk and committed, regardless of
write operations. Defaults to <code class="literal">5s</code>. Values less than <code class="literal">100ms</code> are not allowed.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">index.translog.durability</code>

<dd>
<p>Whether or not to <code class="literal">fsync</code> and commit the translog after every index, delete,

<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">request</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
(default) <code class="literal">fsync</code> and commit after every request. In the event
of hardware failure, all acknowledged writes will already have been
committed to disk.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">async</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<code class="literal">fsync</code> and commit in the background every <code class="literal">sync_interval</code>. In
the event of hardware failure, all acknowledged writes since the last

The translog stores all operations that are not yet safely persisted in Lucene
(i.e., are not part of a Lucene commit point). Although these operations are
available for reads, they will need to be reindexed if the shard was to
shutdown and has to be recovered. This settings controls the maximum total size
of these operations, to prevent recoveries from taking too long. Once the
maximum size has been reached a flush will happen, generating a new Lucene
commit point. Defaults to <code class="literal">512mb</code>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">index.translog.retention.size</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The total size of translog files to keep. Keeping more translog files increases
the chance of performing an operation based sync when recovering replicas. If
the translog files are not sufficient, replica recovery will fall back to a
file based sync. Defaults to <code class="literal">512mb</code>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">index.translog.retention.age</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The maximum duration for which translog files will be kept. Defaults to <code class="literal">12h</code>.

<p>This tool is deprecated and will be completely removed in 7.0.

</div>
</div>
<p>In some cases (a bad drive, user error) the translog on a shard copy can become
corrupted. When this corruption is detected by Elasticsearch due to mismatching
checksums, Elasticsearch will fail that shard copy and refuse to use that copy
of the data.  If there are other copies of the shard available then
Elasticsearch will automatically recover from one of them using the normal
shard allocation and recovery mechanism.  In particular, if the corrupt shard
copy was the primary when the corruption was detected then one of its replicas
will be promoted in its place.</p>
<p>If there is no copy of the data from which Elasticsearch can recover
successfully, a user may want to recover the data that is part of the shard at
the cost of losing the data that is currently contained in the translog. We
provide a command-line tool for this, <code class="literal">elasticsearch-translog</code>.</p>
