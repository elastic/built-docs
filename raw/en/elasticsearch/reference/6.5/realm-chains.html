<p><a class="xref" href="realms.html" title="Realms">Realms</a> live within a <em>realm chain</em>. It is essentially a prioritized list of
configured realms (typically of various types). The order of the list determines
the order in which the realms will be consulted. You should make sure each
configured realm has a distinct <code class="literal">order</code> setting. In the event that two or more
realms have the same <code class="literal">order</code>, they will be processed in <code class="literal">name</code> order.
During the authentication process, X-Pack security will consult and try to
authenticate the request one realm at a time.
Once one of the realms successfully authenticates the request, the authentication
is considered to be successful and the authenticated user will be associated
with the request (which will then proceed to the authorization phase). If a realm
cannot authenticate the request, the next in line realm in the chain will be
consulted. If all realms in the chain could not authenticate the request, the
authentication is then considered to be unsuccessful and an authentication error
will be returned (as HTTP status code <code class="literal">401</code>).</p>

<p>Some systems (e.g. Active Directory) have a temporary lock-out period after
      several successive failed login attempts. If the same username exists in
      multiple realms, unintentional account lockouts are possible. For more
      information, please see <a class="xref" href="trouble-shoot-active-directory.html" title="Users are frequently locked out of Active Directory">here</a>.</p>

<p>The default realm chain contains the <code class="literal">native</code> and <code class="literal">file</code> realms. To explicitly,
configure a realm chain, you specify the chain in <code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code>. When you
configure a realm chain, only the realms you specify are used for authentication.
To use the <code class="literal">native</code> and <code class="literal">file</code> realms, you must include them in the chain.</p>
<p>The following snippet configures a realm chain that includes the <code class="literal">file</code> and
<code class="literal">native</code> realms, as well as two LDAP realms and an Active Directory realm.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">

<p>As can be seen above, each realm has a unique name that identifies it and each
realm type dictates its own set of required and optional settings. That said,
there are
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/security-settings.html#ref-realm-settings" class="ulink" target="_top">settings that are common to all realms</a>.</p>

<p>Some realms have the ability to perform <em>authentication</em> internally, but delegate the
lookup and assignment of roles (that is, <em>authorization</em>) to another realm.</p>
<p>For example, you may wish to use a PKI realm to authenticate your users with
TLS client certificates, but then lookup that user in an LDAP realm and use
their LDAP group assignments to determine their roles in Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>Any realm that supports retrieving users (without needing their credentials)
can be used as an <em>authorization realm</em> (that is, its name may appear as one of
the values in the list of <code class="literal">authorization_realms</code>). See <a class="xref" href="run-as-privilege.html" title="Submitting requests on behalf of other users">Submitting requests on behalf of other users</a> for
further explanation on which realms support this.</p>
<p>For realms that support this feature, it can be enabled by configuring the
<code class="literal">authorization_realms</code> setting on the authenticating realm. Check the list of
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/security-settings.html#realm-settings" class="ulink" target="_top">supported settings</a> for each realm to see if they support the <code class="literal">authorization_realms</code> setting.</p>
<p>If delegated authorization is enabled for a realm, it authenticates the user in
its standard manner (including relevant caching) then looks for that user in the
configured list of authorization realms. It tries each realm in the order they
are specified in the <code class="literal">authorization_realms</code> setting. The user is retrieved by
principal - the user must have identical usernames in the <em>authentication</em> and
<em>authorization realms</em>. If the user cannot be found in any of the authorization
realms, authentication fails.</p>
