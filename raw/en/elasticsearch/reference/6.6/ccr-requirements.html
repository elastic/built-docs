<p>Cross-cluster replication works by replaying the history of individual write
operations that were performed on the shards of the leader index. This means that the
history of these operations needs to be retained on the leader shards so that
they can be pulled by the follower shard tasks. The underlying mechanism used to
retain these operations is <em>soft deletes</em>. A soft delete occurs whenever an
existing document is deleted or updated. By retaining these soft deletes up to
configurable limits, the history of operations can be retained on the leader
shards and made available to the follower shard tasks as it replays the history
of operations.</p>
<p>Soft deletes must be enabled for indices that you want to use as leader
indices. Enabling soft deletes requires the addition of some index settings at
index creation time. You must add these settings to your create index
requests or to the index templates that you use to manage the creation of new
indices.</p>

<p>This means that cross-cluster replication can not be used on existing indices. If you have
existing data that you want to replicate from another cluster, you must

<p>If you want to replicate indices created by APM Server or Beats, and are
allowing APM Server or Beats to manage index templates, you need to enable
soft deletes on the underlying index templates. To enable soft deletes on the
underlying index templates, incorporate the following changes to the relevant
APM Server or Beats configuration file.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">setup.template.overwrite: true
setup.template.settings:
  index.soft_deletes.enabled: true
  index.soft_deletes.retention.operations: 1024</pre>
</div>
<p>For additional information on controlling the index templates managed by APM
Server or Beats, see the relevant documentation on loading the Elasticsearch
index template.</p>

<p>If you want to replicate indices created by Logstash, and are using Logstash to
manage index templates, you need to configure soft deletes on a custom Logstash
index template. To configure soft deletes on the underlying index template,
incorporate the following change to a custom Logstash template.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">{
  "settings" : {
    "index.soft_deletes.enabled" : true,
    "index.soft_deletes.retention.operations" : 1024
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>Additionally, you will need to configure the Elasticsearch output plugin to use
this custom template.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-ruby">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-ruby">output {
  elasticsearch {
    template =&gt; "/path/to/custom/logstash/template.json"
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>For additional information on controlling the index templates managed by
Logstash, see the relevant documentation on the Elasticsearch output plugin.</p>
