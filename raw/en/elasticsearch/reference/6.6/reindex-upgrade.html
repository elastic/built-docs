<p>Elasticsearch can read indices created in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>previous major version</strong></span>.
Older indices must be reindexed or deleted. Elasticsearch 6.x
can use indices created in Elasticsearch 5.x, but not those created in
Elasticsearch 2.x or before. Elasticsearch 5.x can use indices created in
Elasticsearch 2.x, but not those created in 1.x or before.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch nodes will fail to start if incompatible indices are present.</p>
<p>To upgrade an Elasticsearch 5.x cluster that contains indices created in 2.x,
you must reindex or delete them before upgrading to 6.x.
For more information, see <a class="xref" href="reindex-upgrade-inplace.html" title="Reindex in place">Reindex in place</a>.</p>
<p>To upgrade an Elasticsearch cluster running 2.x, you have two options:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Perform a <a class="xref" href="restart-upgrade.html" title="Full cluster restart upgrade">full cluster restart upgrade</a> to 5.6,

<a class="xref" href="rolling-upgrades.html" title="Rolling upgrades">rolling upgrade</a> to 6.x. If your Elasticsearch 2.x
cluster contains indices that were created before 2.x, you must either
delete or reindex them before upgrading to 5.6. For more information about
upgrading from 2.x to 5.6, see <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/setup-upgrade.html" class="ulink" target="_top">

<p>To upgrade an Elasticsearch 1.x cluster, you have two options:</p>

Then, perform a full cluster restart upgrade to 5.6 and reindex or delete
the 2.x indices. Finally, perform a <a class="xref" href="rolling-upgrades.html" title="Rolling upgrades">rolling upgrade</a>

<p>If you use time-based indices, you likely won&#8217;t need to carry
pre-5.x indices forward to 6.x. Data in time-based indices
generally becomes less useful as time passes and are
deleted as they age past your retention period.</p>
<p>Unless you have an unusally long retention period, you can just
wait to upgrade to 6.x until all of your pre-5.x indices have
been deleted.</p>
