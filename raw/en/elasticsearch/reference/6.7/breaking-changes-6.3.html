<h3><a id="breaking_63_api_changes"></a>API changes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/migration/migrate_6_3.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<h4><a id="_suggest_stats_metrics_deprecated"></a>Suggest stats metrics deprecated<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/migration/migrate_6_3.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The suggest stats were previously folded into the search on the indices stats
API. As such, the <code class="literal">suggest</code> metric on the indices stats API has been a synonym
for the <code class="literal">search</code> metric. In 6.3.0, the <code class="literal">suggest</code> metric is deprecated in favor
of using <code class="literal">search</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <code class="literal">suggest</code> index metric on the <code class="literal">indices</code> metric on the nodes stats
API has provided a response containing only an empty object since 5.0.0. In
6.3.0 this metric has been deprecated.</p>
<h3><a id="breaking_63_packaging_changes"></a>Packaging changes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/migration/migrate_6_3.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Starting with version 6.3, all of the X-Pack features ship with the default
distribution of Elasticsearch. You no longer need to install X-Pack separately.</p>
<h4><a id="deprecation_of_the_literal_x_pack_literal_configuration_directory"></a>Deprecation of the <code class="literal">x-pack</code> configuration directory<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/migration/migrate_6_3.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>In 6.2 and earlier releases, the
<a class="xref" href="security-files.html" title="Security files">security configuration files</a>, such as the
<code class="literal">log4j2.properties</code>, <code class="literal">role_mapping.yml</code>, <code class="literal">roles.yml</code>, <code class="literal">users</code>, and <code class="literal">users_roles</code>
files, were located in an <code class="literal">x-pack</code> directory within the
<a class="xref" href="settings.html#config-files-location" title="Config files location">config directory</a>.</p>
<p>Starting in 6.3, the security configuration files are located directly in the
config directory.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If you upgraded to 6.3, your old security configuration files still
exist in an <code class="literal">x-pack</code> folder. That path is deprecated, however, and you should
move your files out of that folder. There is a known problem where the files in
the old path are disregarded in favor of the files in the new path:
<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull//33688" class="ulink" target="_top">#33688</a>. For more information, see
<a class="xref" href="trb-security-path.html" title="Failures due to relocation of the configuration files">Failures due to relocation of the configuration files</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Settings such as <code class="literal">files.role_mapping</code> now default to
<code class="literal">ES_PATH_CONF/role_mapping.yml</code>. If you do not want to use the default locations,
you must update the settings appropriately. See <a class="xref" href="security-settings.html" title="Security settings in Elasticsearch">Security settings</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="breaking_63_plugins_changes"></a>Plugins changes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/migration/migrate_6_3.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<h4><a id="_gcs_repository_plugin_2"></a>GCS Repository plugin<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/migration/migrate_6_3.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The repository settings <code class="literal">application_name</code>, <code class="literal">connect_timeout</code> and <code class="literal">read_timeout</code>
have been deprecated and must now be specified in the client settings instead.</p>
<p>See <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/6.7/repository-gcs-client.html#repository-gcs-client" class="ulink" target="_top">Google Cloud Storage Client Settings</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="_ingest_geoip_plugin"></a>Ingest Geoip Plugin<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/migration/migrate_6_3.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>In earlier versions, database files have been stored as gzip compressed files
with the extension <code class="literal">.gz</code> to save disk space. As a consequence, database files
had to be loaded in memory. Now the default database files that are stored
uncompressed as <code class="literal">.mmdb</code> files which allows to memory-map them and save heap
memory. Any custom database files must also be stored uncompressed. Consequently,
the <code class="literal">database_file</code> property in any ingest pipelines that use the Geoip Processor
must refer to the uncompressed database files as well.</p>
<h4><a id="_using_the_plugin_installer_without_a_tty"></a>Using the plugin installer without a TTY<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/migration/migrate_6_3.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The Elasticsearch plugin installer (<code class="literal">elasticsearch-plugin install</code>) would
previously silently accept additional security permissions required by a plugin
if standard input was closed or there was no TTY attached (e.g., <code class="literal">docker exec
&lt;container ID&gt; elasticsearch-plugin install</code>). This silent accepting of
additional security permissions has been removed. Now, a user must deliberately
accept these permissions either by keeping standard input open and attaching a
TTY (i.e., using interactive mode to accept the permissions), or by passing the
<code class="literal">--batch</code> flag.</p>
<h4><a id="_implementing_custom_realms_with_spi_instead_of_xpackextension"></a>Implementing custom realms with SPI instead of XPackExtension<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/migration/migrate_6_3.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The legacy <code class="literal">XPackExtension</code> extension mechanism has been removed and replaced
with an SPI based extension mechanism that is installed and built as an
elasticsearch plugin. For more information about using SPI loaded security
extensions in custom realms, see <a class="xref" href="custom-realms.html" title="Integrating with other authentication systems">Integrating with other authentication systems</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="breaking_63_settings_changes"></a>Settings changes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/migration/migrate_6_3.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<h4><a id="_concurrency_level_of_analyze_requests"></a>Concurrency level of analyze requests<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/migration/migrate_6_3.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Previously, analyze requests would run on the same thread pool as indexing
requests. The <code class="literal">index</code> thread pool has been deprecated as it is no longer needed
since indexing requests are internally converted to bulk requests and run on the
<code class="literal">bulk</code> thread pool. This leaves analyze requests without a home so we added a
small thread pool called the <code class="literal">analyze</code> thread pool. This thread pool defaults to
having one thread and a queue depth of sixteen requests. This means that
previously analyze requests had a level of concurrency equal to the size of the
<code class="literal">index</code> thread pool and now they have a level of concurrency of one. For most
users we think this is fine as analyze requests are useful for debugging and so
probably do not see high concurrency. If you are impacted by this you can
increase the size of the thread pool by using the <code class="literal">thread_pool.analyze.size</code>
setting.</p>
<h4><a id="_renaming_the_bulk_thread_pool"></a>Renaming the bulk thread pool<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/migration/migrate_6_3.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The <code class="literal">bulk</code> thread pool has been renamed to the <code class="literal">write</code> thread pool. This change
was made to reflect the fact that this thread pool is used to execute all write
operations: single-document index/delete/update requests, as well as bulk
requests. The settings <code class="literal">thread_pool.bulk.size</code> and <code class="literal">thread_pool.bulk.queue_size</code>
are still supported as fallback settings although you should transition to
<code class="literal">thread_pool.write.size</code> and <code class="literal">thread_pool.write.queue_size</code>, respectively. The
fallback settings will be removed in 7.0.0. Additionally, this means that some
APIs (e.g., the node stats API) will now display the name of this thread pool as
<code class="literal">write</code>. If this change impacts you (e.g., for monitoring that you have in
place) you can start Elasticsearch with the JVM option
<code class="literal">-Des.thread_pool.write.use_bulk_as_display_name=true</code> to have Elasticsearch
continue to display the name of this thread pool as <code class="literal">bulk</code>. Elasticsearch will
stop observing this system property in 7.0.0.</p>
<h4><a id="_enabling_monitoring"></a>Enabling monitoring<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/migration/migrate_6_3.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>By default when you install X-Pack, monitoring is enabled but data collection
is disabled. To enable data collection, use the new
<code class="literal">xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled</code> setting. You can update this setting by
using the <a class="xref" href="cluster-update-settings.html" title="Cluster Update Settings">Cluster Update Settings API</a>. For more
information, see <a class="xref" href="monitoring-settings.html" title="Monitoring settings in Elasticsearch">Monitoring settings</a>.</p>
