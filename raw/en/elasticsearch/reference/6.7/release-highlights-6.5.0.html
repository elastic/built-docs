<h3><a id="_audit_security_events_in_new_structured_logs"></a>Audit security events in new structured logs<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-6.5.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>By default, when you enable auditing, it uses the
<a class="xref" href="audit-log-output.html" title="Logfile audit output">logfile audit output</a>, which persists events to
a <code class="literal">&lt;clustername&gt;_audit.log</code> file in the logs directory. This file is new to
version 6.5 and prints audit entries as JSON documents.</p>
<p>For backwards compatibility purposes, a <code class="literal">&lt;clustername&gt;_access.log</code> with the old style of
formatting is also generated. See also <a class="xref" href="breaking-changes-6.5.html#breaking_65_settings_changes" title="Settings changes">Settings changes</a>. Due to this,
the logging throughput effectively doubles. It is recommended that you enable only the
new audit format in production (by adjusting the settings in the <code class="literal">log4j2.properties</code> file).</p>

This functionality is experimental and may be changed or removed completely in a future release. Elastic will take a best effort approach to fix any issues, but experimental features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
</span>
</span> The new <a class="xref" href="ml-find-file-structure.html" title="Find file structure API">find file structure API</a>
determines the structure of a text file. It also returns statistics about the
most common values of the detected fields and mappings that you can use when you
ingest the file into Elasticsearch. If you want to influence the output, you can specify
optional parameters. For example, if the file contains semi-structured text, you
can specify a Grok pattern or let the tool generate it. This API is also used by
the new File Data Visualizer in Kibana.</p>
<h3><a id="_improved_machine_learning_results_for_partitioned_multi_metric_jobs"></a>Improved machine learning results for partitioned multi-metric jobs<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-6.5.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If you use the <code class="literal">partition_field_name</code> or <code class="literal">by_field_name</code> parameters in a machine learning job (or the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Split Data</strong></span> field in the Kibana multi-metric job wizard), it generates many
simultaneous analyses that are modeled independently. In 6.5, we have decreased
the influence of the anomaly scores in each partition on other partitions' scores.
As a result, record- and influencer-level results produce a much wider range of scores,
but the overall anomaly score still uses sophisticated aggregation to ensure rate-limited
alerts for the job.</p>
<h3><a id="_find_multi_bucket_anomalies_in_machine_learning_jobs"></a>Find multi-bucket anomalies in machine learning jobs<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-6.5.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes events are not interesting or anomalous in the context of a single
bucket. However, they become interesting when you take into consideration a
sequence of buckets as a whole. In 6.5, there is a new machine learning
<em>multi-bucket analysis</em>, which uses features from multiple contiguous buckets
for anomaly detection. The final anomaly score is now a combination of values
from both the “standard” single-bucket analysis and the new multi-bucket
analysis. A new <code class="literal">multi_bucket_impact</code> property in the
<a class="xref" href="ml-results-resource.html#ml-results-records" title="Records">record results</a> indicates how strongly either form of
analysis influences the score. In Kibana, anomalies with medium or high
multi-bucket impact are depicted in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span> and the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span> with a cross symbol instead of a dot.</p>
<h3><a id="_create_source_only_snapshots"></a>Create source-only snapshots<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-6.5.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><a class="xref" href="modules-snapshots.html#_source_only_repository" title="Source Only Repository">Source-only snapshots</a> save space on disk by only
saving stored fields and index metadata. This can result in up to 50% reduction
in size. Index and doc values are not included, so a restored source-only
snapshot is not searchable. You must reindex the data into a new index after it&#8217;s
restored.</p>
<h3><a id="_apply_token_filters_conditionally"></a>Apply token filters conditionally<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-6.5.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The <a class="xref" href="analysis-condition-tokenfilter.html" title="Conditional Token Filter">conditional token filter</a> enables you to
use inline Painless scripts to filter out terms. Previously, conditionally
applying token filters required creating and using custom analysis plugins.</p>
<h3><a id="_use_odbc_to_connect_to_elasticsearch_sql"></a>Use ODBC to connect to Elasticsearch SQL<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-6.5.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elasticsearch SQL now supports ODBC mode in addition to JDBC. The functionality is
currently the same as JDBC. An alpha version of the ODBC client is now
available for download.</p>
<h3><a id="_delegate_authorization_to_other_realms"></a>Delegate authorization to other realms<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-6.5.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If you enable the Elasticsearch security features, some realms now have the
ability to perform <em>authentication</em> internally then delegate <em>authorization</em> to
another realm. For example, you could authenticate using PKI then delegate to an
LDAP realm for role information. The realms that support this feature have a
new <code class="literal">authorization_realms</code> setting that you can configure in the
<code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code> file. For more information, see
<a class="xref" href="realm-chains.html#authorization_realms" title="Delegating authorization to another realm">Delegating authorization to another realm</a> and <a class="xref" href="security-settings.html#realm-settings" title="Realm settings">Realm settings</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_cross_cluster_replication_beta_superscript_superscript"></a>Cross-cluster replication (beta<sup>*</sup>)<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-6.5.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Cross-cluster replication enables you to replicate indices that exist in remote
clusters to your local cluster. You create an index in your local cluster
(known as a <em>follower index</em>) that follows an index (known as a <em>leader index</em>)
in a remote cluster. You can also automatically follow indices in a
remote cluster that match a pattern. The individual write operations that occur
on the leader indices are then replayed on the follower indices. This
functionality is useful for replicating data to a second cluster for disaster
recovery purposes and for geo-proximity so that reads can be served locally.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack-overview/6.7/xpack-ccr.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Cross-cluster replication</a>
and <a class="xref" href="ccr-apis.html" title="Cross-cluster replication APIs"><em>Cross-cluster replication APIs</em></a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_monitor_elasticsearch_with_metricbeat_beta_superscript_superscript"></a>Monitor Elasticsearch with Metricbeat (beta<sup>*</sup>)<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/6.7/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-6.5.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In 6.4 and later, you can use Metricbeat to collect data about Kibana and ship
it directly to your monitoring cluster, rather than routing it through Elasticsearch. Now
in 6.5, you can also use Metricbeat to collect and ship data about Elasticsearch. If
you are monitoring Logstash or Beats, at this time you must still use exporters to
route the data. See <a class="xref" href="configuring-metricbeat.html" title="Collecting Elasticsearch monitoring data with Metricbeat"><em>Collecting monitoring data with Metricbeat</em></a> and
<a class="xref" href="how-monitoring-works.html" title="How monitoring works"><em>How it works</em></a>.</p>
<p><sup>*</sup> This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code
is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no
warranties. Please try this functionality in your test and development environments
and provide feedback in the <a href="https://discuss.elastic.co/" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic community forums</a>.</p>
