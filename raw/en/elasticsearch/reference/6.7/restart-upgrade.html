<p>A full cluster restart upgrade requires that you shut all nodes in the cluster
down, upgrade them, and restart the cluster. A full cluster restart was required
when upgrading to major versions prior to 6.x. Elasticsearch 6.x supports
<a class="xref" href="rolling-upgrades.html" title="Rolling upgrades">rolling upgrades</a> from <span class="strong strong"><strong>Elasticsearch 5.6</strong></span>. Upgrading to
6.x from earlier versions requires a full cluster restart. See the
<a class="xref" href="setup-upgrade.html#upgrade-paths">Upgrade paths table</a> to verify the type of upgrade you need
to perform.</p>
<p>To perform a full cluster restart upgrade:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Disable shard allocation.</strong></span></p>
<p>When you shut down a node, the allocation process waits for
<code class="literal">index.unassigned.node_left.delayed_timeout</code> (by default, one minute) before
starting to replicate the shards on that node to other nodes in the cluster,
which can involve a lot of I/O.  Since the node is shortly going to be
restarted, this I/O is unnecessary. You can avoid racing the clock by
<a class="xref" href="shards-allocation.html" title="Cluster Level Shard Allocation">disabling allocation</a> of replicas before shutting down
the node:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "primaries"
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/56.console"></div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Stop indexing and perform a synced flush.</strong></span></p>
<p>Performing a <a class="xref" href="indices-synced-flush.html" title="Synced Flush">synced-flush</a> speeds up shard
recovery.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">POST _flush/synced</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/57.console"></div>
<p>When you perform a synced flush, check the response to make sure there are
no failures. Synced flush operations that fail due to pending indexing
operations are listed in the response body, although the request itself
still returns a 200 OK status. If there are failures, reissue the request.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Stop any machine learning jobs that are running.</strong></span></p>
<p>If your machine learning indices were created earlier than the previous major version, they
must be reindexed. In those circumstances, there must be no machine learning
jobs running during the upgrade.</p>
<p>In all other circumstances, there is no requirement to close your machine learning jobs.
There are, however, advantages to doing so. If you choose to leave your jobs
running during the upgrade, they are affected when you stop the machine learning nodes. The
jobs move to another machine learning node and restore the model states. This scenario has
the least disruption to the active machine learning jobs but incurs the highest load on the
cluster.</p>
<p>To close all machine learning jobs before you upgrade, see
<a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack-overview/6.7/stopping-ml.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Stopping machine learning</a>. This method persists the model
state at the moment of closure, which means that when you open your jobs after
the upgrade, they use the exact same model. This scenario takes the most time,
however, especially if you have many jobs or jobs with large model states.</p>
<p>To temporarily halt the tasks associated with your machine learning jobs and datafeeds and
prevent new jobs from opening, use the <a class="xref" href="ml-set-upgrade-mode.html" title="Set upgrade mode API">set upgrade mode API</a>:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">POST _ml/set_upgrade_mode?enabled=true</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/58.console"></div>
<p>This method does not persist the absolute latest model state, rather it uses the
last model state that was automatically saved. By halting the tasks, you avoid
incurring the cost of managing active jobs during the upgrade and it&#8217;s quicker
than stopping datafeeds and closing jobs.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from a version prior to 6.3 and use X-Pack
then you must remove the X-Pack plugin before upgrading with
<code class="literal">bin/elasticsearch-plugin remove x-pack</code>. As of 6.3, X-Pack is included in
the default distribution so make sure to upgrade to that one. If you upgrade
without removing the X-Pack plugin first the node will fail to start. If you
did not remove the X-Pack plugin and the node fails to start then you must
downgrade to your previous version, remove X-Pack, and then upgrade again.
In general downgrading is not supported but in this particular case it is.</p>

<p>When you extract the zip or tarball packages, the <code class="literal">elasticsearch-n.n.n</code>
directory contains the Elasticsearch <code class="literal">config</code>, <code class="literal">data</code>, <code class="literal">logs</code> and
<code class="literal">plugins</code> directories.</p>
<p>We recommend moving these directories out of the Elasticsearch directory
so that there is no chance of deleting them when you upgrade Elasticsearch.
To specify the new locations, use the <code class="literal">ES_PATH_CONF</code> environment
variable and the <code class="literal">path.data</code> and <code class="literal">path.logs</code> settings. For more information,
see <a class="xref" href="important-settings.html" title="Important Elasticsearch configuration">Important Elasticsearch configuration</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="xref" href="deb.html" title="Install Elasticsearch with Debian Package">Debian</a> and <a class="xref" href="rpm.html" title="Install Elasticsearch with RPM">RPM</a> packages place these directories in the

<p>If you have dedicated master nodes, start them first and wait for them to

You can check progress by looking at the logs.</p>
<p>As soon as the <a class="xref" href="modules-discovery-zen.html#master-election" title="Master Election">minimum number of master-eligible nodes</a>
have discovered each other, they form a cluster and elect a master. At
that point, you can use <a class="xref" href="cat-health.html" title="cat health"><code class="literal">_cat/health</code></a> and
<a class="xref" href="cat-nodes.html" title="cat nodes"><code class="literal">_cat/nodes</code></a> to monitor nodes joining the cluster:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET _cat/health

<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/59.console"></div>
<p>The <code class="literal">status</code> column returned by <code class="literal">_cat/health</code> shows the health of each node
in the cluster: <code class="literal">red</code>, <code class="literal">yellow</code>, or <code class="literal">green</code>.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Wait for all nodes to join the cluster and report a status of yellow.</strong></span></p>
<p>When a node joins the cluster, it begins to recover any primary shards that
are stored locally. The <a class="xref" href="cat-health.html" title="cat health"><code class="literal">_cat/health</code></a> API initially reports
a <code class="literal">status</code> of <code class="literal">red</code>, indicating that not all primary shards have been allocated.</p>
<p>Once a node recovers its local shards, the cluster <code class="literal">status</code> switches to <code class="literal">yellow</code>,
indicating that all primary shards have been recovered, but not all replica
shards are allocated. This is to be expected because you have not yet
reenabled allocation. Delaying the allocation of replicas until all nodes
are <code class="literal">yellow</code> allows the master to allocate replicas to nodes that
already have local shard copies.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Reenable allocation.</strong></span></p>
<p>When all nodes have joined the cluster and recovered their primary shards,
reenable allocation by restoring <code class="literal">cluster.routing.allocation.enable</code> to its
default:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": null
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/60.console"></div>
<p>Once allocation is reenabled, the cluster starts allocating replica shards to
the data nodes. At this point it is safe to resume indexing and searching,
but your cluster will recover more quickly if you can wait until all primary
and replica shards have been successfully allocated and the status of all nodes
is <code class="literal">green</code>.</p>
<p>You can monitor progress with the <a class="xref" href="cat-health.html" title="cat health"><code class="literal">_cat/health</code></a> and
