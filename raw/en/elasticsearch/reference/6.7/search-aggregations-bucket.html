<p>Bucket aggregations don&#8217;t calculate metrics over fields like the metrics aggregations do, but instead, they create
buckets of documents. Each bucket is associated with a criterion (depending on the aggregation type) which determines
whether or not a document in the current context "falls" into it. In other words, the buckets effectively define document
sets. In addition to the buckets themselves, the <code class="literal">bucket</code> aggregations also compute and return the number of documents
that "fell into" each bucket.</p>
<p>Bucket aggregations, as opposed to <code class="literal">metrics</code> aggregations, can hold sub-aggregations. These sub-aggregations will be
aggregated for the buckets created by their "parent" bucket aggregation.</p>
<p>There are different bucket aggregators, each with a different "bucketing" strategy. Some define a single bucket, some
define fixed number of multiple buckets, and others dynamically create the buckets during the aggregation process.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The maximum number of buckets allowed in a single response is limited by a dynamic cluster
setting named <code class="literal">search.max_buckets</code>. It is disabled by default (-1) but requests that try to return more than
10,000 buckets (the default value for future versions) will log a deprecation warning.</p>
