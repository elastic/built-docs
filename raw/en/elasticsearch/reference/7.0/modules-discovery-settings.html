<p>Discovery and cluster formation are affected by the following settings:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">discovery.seed_hosts</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Provides a list of master-eligible nodes in the cluster. Each value has the
format <code class="literal">host:port</code> or <code class="literal">host</code>, where <code class="literal">port</code> defaults to the setting
<code class="literal">transport.profiles.default.port</code>. Note that IPv6 hosts must be bracketed.
The default value is <code class="literal">["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]</code>. See <a class="xref" href="discovery-settings.html#unicast.hosts" title="discovery.seed_hosts"><code class="literal">discovery.seed_hosts</code></a>. This
setting was previously known as <code class="literal">discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts</code>. Its old
name is deprecated but continues to work in order to preserve backwards
compatibility. Support for the old name will be removed in a future
version.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">discovery.seed_providers</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Specifies which types of <a class="xref" href="modules-discovery-hosts-providers.html#built-in-hosts-providers" title="Seed hosts providers">seed hosts provider</a>
to use to obtain the addresses of the seed nodes used to start the
discovery process. By default, it is the
<a class="xref" href="modules-discovery-hosts-providers.html#settings-based-hosts-provider" title="Settings-based seed hosts provider">settings-based seed hosts provider</a>.  This
setting was previously known as <code class="literal">discovery.zen.hosts_provider</code>. Its old
name is deprecated but continues to work in order to preserve backwards
compatibility. Support for the old name will be removed in a future
version.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">discovery.type</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Specifies whether Elasticsearch should form a multiple-node cluster. By default, Elasticsearch
discovers other nodes when forming a cluster and allows other nodes to join
the cluster later. If <code class="literal">discovery.type</code> is set to <code class="literal">single-node</code>, Elasticsearch forms a
single-node cluster. For more information about when you might use this
setting, see <a class="xref" href="bootstrap-checks.html#single-node-discovery" title="Single-node discovery">Single-node discovery</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cluster.initial_master_nodes</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Sets the initial set of master-eligible nodes in a brand-new cluster. By
default this list is empty, meaning that this node expects to join a cluster
that has already been bootstrapped. See <a class="xref" href="discovery-settings.html#initial_master_nodes" title="cluster.initial_master_nodes"><code class="literal">cluster.initial_master_nodes</code></a>.

<p>Discovery and cluster formation are also affected by the following
<em>expert-level</em> settings, although it is not recommended to change any of these
from their default values.</p>

<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">discovery.cluster_formation_warning_timeout</code>
</span>
</dt>

that the cluster did not form. Defaults to <code class="literal">10s</code>. If a cluster has not
formed after <code class="literal">discovery.cluster_formation_warning_timeout</code> has elapsed then
the node will log a warning message that starts with the phrase <code class="literal">master not
discovered</code> which describes the current state of the discovery process.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">discovery.find_peers_interval</code>

addresses of seed nodes. Defaults to <code class="literal">10</code>. This setting was previously
known as <code class="literal">discovery.zen.ping.unicast.concurrent_connects</code>. Its old name is
deprecated but continues to work in order to preserve backwards
compatibility. Support for the old name will be removed in a future
version.

known as <code class="literal">discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts.resolve_timeout</code>. Its old name
is deprecated but continues to work in order to preserve backwards
compatibility. Support for the old name will be removed in a future

<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cluster.auto_shrink_voting_configuration</code>

</dt>
<dd>
Controls whether the <a class="xref" href="modules-discovery-voting.html" title="Voting configurations">voting configuration</a>
sheds departed nodes automatically, as long as it still contains at least 3
nodes. The default value is <code class="literal">true</code>. If set to <code class="literal">false</code>, the voting

</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">

<dd>
Sets the amount to increase the upper bound on the wait before an election
on each election failure. Note that this is <em>linear</em> backoff. This defaults
to <code class="literal">100ms</code>. Changing this setting from the default may cause your cluster
to fail to elect a master node.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cluster.election.duration</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Sets how long each election is allowed to take before a node considers it
to have failed and schedules a retry. This defaults to <code class="literal">500ms</code>.  Changing
this setting from the default may cause your cluster to fail to elect a
master node.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cluster.election.initial_timeout</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Sets the upper bound on how long a node will wait initially, or after the
elected master fails, before attempting its first election. This defaults
to <code class="literal">100ms</code>. Changing this setting from the default may cause your cluster

</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cluster.election.max_timeout</code>
</span>

Sets the maximum upper bound on how long a node will wait before attempting
an first election, so that an network partition that lasts for a long time
does not result in excessively sparse elections. This defaults to <code class="literal">10s</code>.
Changing this setting from the default may cause your cluster to fail to
elect a master node.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">

<code class="literal">cluster.fault_detection.follower_check.retry_count</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Sets how many consecutive follower check failures must occur to each node
before the elected master considers that node to be faulty and removes it
from the cluster. Defaults to <code class="literal">3</code>. Changing this setting from the default
may cause your cluster to become unstable.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cluster.fault_detection.leader_check.interval</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Sets how long each node waits between checks of the elected master.

</dt>
<dd>
Sets how long each node waits for a response to a leader check from the
elected master before considering it to have failed. Defaults to <code class="literal">10s</code>.
Changing this setting from the default may cause your cluster to become
unstable.
</dd>

<dd>
Sets how long the master node waits to receive acknowledgements for cluster
state updates from lagging nodes. The default value is <code class="literal">90s</code>. If a node
does not successfully apply the cluster state update within this period of
time, it is considered to have failed and is removed from the cluster. See
<a class="xref" href="cluster-state-publishing.html" title="Publishing the cluster state">Publishing the cluster state</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cluster.join.timeout</code>

<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">cluster.max_voting_config_exclusions</code>
</span>

<a id="no-master-block"></a><code class="literal">cluster.no_master_block</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Specifies which operations are rejected when there is no active master in a
cluster. This setting has two valid values:
</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">all</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
All operations on the node (both read and write operations) are rejected.
This also applies for API cluster state read or write operations, like the get
index settings, put mapping and cluster state API.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">write</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
(default) Write operations are rejected. Read operations succeed,
based on the last known cluster configuration. This situation may result in
partial reads of stale data as this node may be isolated from the rest of the
cluster.
