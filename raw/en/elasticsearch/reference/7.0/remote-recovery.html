<p>When you create a follower index, you cannot use it until it is fully initialized.
The <em>remote recovery</em> process builds a new copy of a shard on a follower node by
copying data from the primary shard in the leader cluster. Elasticsearch uses this remote
recovery process to bootstrap a follower index using the data from the leader index.
This process provides the follower with a copy of the current state of the leader index,
even if a complete history of changes is not available on the leader due to Lucene
segment merging.</p>
<p>Remote recovery is a network intensive process that transfers all of the Lucene
segment files from the leader cluster to the follower cluster. The follower
requests that a recovery session be initiated on the primary shard in the leader
cluster. The follower then requests file chunks concurrently from the leader. By
default, the process concurrently requests <code class="literal">5</code> large <code class="literal">1mb</code> file chunks. This default
behavior is designed to support leader and follower clusters with high network latency
between them.</p>
<p>There are dynamic settings that you can use to rate-limit the transmitted data
and manage the resources consumed by remote recoveries. See
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/ccr-settings.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Cross-cluster replication settings</a>.</p>
<p>You can obtain information about an in-progress remote recovery by using the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/cat-recovery.html" class="ulink" target="_top">recovery API</a> on the follower cluster. Remote recoveries
are implemented using the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/modules-snapshots.html" class="ulink" target="_top">snapshot and restore</a> infrastructure. This means that on-going remote recoveries are labelled as type
<code class="literal">snapshot</code> in the recovery API.</p>
