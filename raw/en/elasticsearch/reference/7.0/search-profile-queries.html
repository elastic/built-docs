<p>The details provided by the Profile API directly expose Lucene class names and concepts, which means
that complete interpretation of the results require fairly advanced knowledge of Lucene.  This
page attempts to give a crash-course in how Lucene executes queries so that you can use the Profile API to successfully
diagnose and debug queries, but it is only an overview.  For complete understanding, please refer
to Lucene&#8217;s documentation and, in places, the code.</p>
<p>With that said, a complete understanding is often not required to fix a slow query.  It is usually
sufficient to see that a particular component of a query is slow, and not necessarily understand why
the <code class="literal">advance</code> phase of that query is the cause, for example.</p>

<p>The <code class="literal">query</code> section contains detailed timing of the query tree executed by Lucene on a particular shard.
The overall structure of this query tree will resemble your original Elasticsearch query, but may be slightly
(or sometimes very) different.  It will also use similar but not always identical naming.  Using our previous
<code class="literal">match</code> query example, let&#8217;s analyze the <code class="literal">query</code> section:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">"query": [
    {
       "type": "BooleanQuery",
       "description": "message:some message:number",
       "time_in_nanos": "1873811",
       "breakdown": {...},               <a id="CO57-1"></a><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i>
       "children": [
          {
             "type": "TermQuery",

             "time_in_nanos": "391943",
             "breakdown": {...}
          },
          {
             "type": "TermQuery",
             "description": "message:number",
             "time_in_nanos": "210682",
             "breakdown": {...}
          }
       ]
    }
]</pre>
</div>
<div class="calloutlist">
<table border="0" summary="Callout list">
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO57-1"><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i></a></p>

</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Based on the profile structure, we can see that our <code class="literal">match</code> query was rewritten by Lucene into a BooleanQuery with two
clauses (both holding a TermQuery).  The <code class="literal">type</code> field displays the Lucene class name, and often aligns with
the equivalent name in Elasticsearch.  The <code class="literal">description</code> field displays the Lucene explanation text for the query, and
is made available to help differentiating between parts of your query (e.g. both <code class="literal">message:search</code> and <code class="literal">message:test</code>
are TermQuery&#8217;s and would appear identical otherwise.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">time_in_nanos</code> field shows that this query took ~1.8ms for the entire BooleanQuery to execute.  The recorded time is inclusive
of all children.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">breakdown</code> field will give detailed stats about how the time was spent, we&#8217;ll look at
that in a moment.  Finally, the <code class="literal">children</code> array lists any sub-queries that may be present.  Because we searched for two
values ("search test"), our BooleanQuery holds two children TermQueries.  They have identical information (type, time,
breakdown, etc).  Children are allowed to have their own children.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>The <code class="literal">breakdown</code> component lists detailed timing statistics about low-level Lucene execution:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">"breakdown": {

}</pre>
</div>
<p>Timings are listed in wall-clock nanoseconds and are not normalized at all.  All caveats about the overall
<code class="literal">time_in_nanos</code> apply here.  The intention of the breakdown is to give you a feel for A) what machinery in Lucene is
actually eating time, and B) the magnitude of differences in times between the various components.  Like the overall time,
the breakdown is inclusive of all children times.</p>
<p>The meaning of the stats are as follows:</p>
<h4><a id="_all_parameters_3"></a>All parameters:<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.0/docs/reference/search/profile.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>

A Query in Lucene must be capable of reuse across multiple IndexSearchers (think of it as the engine that
executes a search against a specific Lucene Index).  This puts Lucene in a tricky spot, since many queries
need to accumulate temporary state/statistics associated with the index it is being used against, but the
Query contract mandates that it must be immutable.
<br>
<br>
To get around this, Lucene asks each query to generate a Weight object which acts as a temporary context
object to hold state associated with this particular (IndexSearcher, Query) tuple.  The <code class="literal">weight</code> metric
shows how long this process takes

<p>
This parameter shows how long it takes to build a Scorer for the query.  A Scorer is the mechanism that
iterates over matching documents and generates a score per-document (e.g. how well does "foo" match the document?).
Note, this records the time required to generate the Scorer object, not actually score the documents.  Some
queries have faster or slower initialization of the Scorer, depending on optimizations, complexity, etc.

This may also show timing associated with caching, if enabled and/or applicable for the query

The Lucene method <code class="literal">next_doc</code> returns Doc ID of the next document matching the query.  This statistic shows
the time it takes to determine which document is the next match, a process that varies considerably depending
on the nature of the query.   Next_doc is a specialized form of advance() which is more convenient for many
queries in Lucene.  It is equivalent to advance(docId() + 1)

<p>
<code class="literal">advance</code> is the "lower level" version of next_doc: it serves the same purpose of finding the next matching
doc, but requires the calling query to perform extra tasks such as identifying and moving past skips, etc.
However,  not all queries can use next_doc, so <code class="literal">advance</code> is also timed for those queries.

Some queries, such as phrase queries, match documents using a "two-phase" process.  First, the document is
"approximately" matched, and if it matches approximately, it is checked a second time with a more rigorous
(and expensive) process.  The second phase verification is what the <code class="literal">match</code> statistic measures.
<br>
<br>
For example, a phrase query first checks a document approximately by ensuring all terms in the phrase are
present in the doc.  If all the terms are present, it then executes the second phase verification to ensure
the terms are in-order to form the phrase, which is relatively more expensive than just checking for presence
of the terms.
<br>
<br>
Because this two-phase process is only used by a handful of queries, the <code class="literal">match</code> statistic is often zero

<p>The Collectors portion of the response shows high-level execution details. Lucene works by defining a "Collector"
which is responsible for coordinating the traversal, scoring, and collection of matching documents.  Collectors
are also how a single query can record aggregation results, execute unscoped "global" queries, execute post-query
filters, etc.</p>
<p>Looking at the previous example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">"collector": [
   {
      "name": "CancellableCollector",
      "reason": "search_cancelled",
      "time_in_nanos": "304311",
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "SimpleTopScoreDocCollector",
          "reason": "search_top_hits",
          "time_in_nanos": "32273"
        }
      ]
   }
]</pre>
</div>
<p>We see a single collector named <code class="literal">SimpleTopScoreDocCollector</code> wrapped into <code class="literal">CancellableCollector</code>. <code class="literal">SimpleTopScoreDocCollector</code> is the default "scoring and sorting"
<code class="literal">Collector</code> used by Elasticsearch.  The <code class="literal">reason</code> field attempts to give a plain English description of the class name.  The
<code class="literal">time_in_nanos</code> is similar to the time in the Query tree: a wall-clock time inclusive of all children.  Similarly, <code class="literal">children</code> lists
all sub-collectors. The <code class="literal">CancellableCollector</code> that wraps <code class="literal">SimpleTopScoreDocCollector</code> is used by Elasticsearch to detect if the current
search was cancelled and stop collecting documents as soon as it occurs.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Collector times are <span class="strong strong"><strong>independent</strong></span> from the Query times.  They are calculated, combined,
and normalized independently!  Due to the nature of Lucene&#8217;s execution, it is impossible to "merge" the times
from the Collectors into the Query section, so they are displayed in separate portions.</p>

<p>All queries in Lucene undergo a "rewriting" process.  A query (and its sub-queries) may be rewritten one or
more times, and the process continues until the query stops changing.  This process allows Lucene to perform
optimizations, such as removing redundant clauses, replacing one query for a more efficient execution path,
etc.  For example a Boolean &#8594; Boolean &#8594; TermQuery can be rewritten to a TermQuery, because all the Booleans
are unnecessary in this case.</p>
<p>The rewriting process is complex and difficult to display, since queries can change drastically.  Rather than
showing the intermediate results, the total rewrite time is simply displayed as a value (in nanoseconds).  This
value is cumulative and contains the total time for all queries being rewritten.</p>

<p>As you can see, the output is significantly more verbose than before.  All the major portions of the query are
represented:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The first <code class="literal">TermQuery</code> (user:test) represents the main <code class="literal">term</code> query
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The second <code class="literal">TermQuery</code> (message:some) represents the <code class="literal">post_filter</code> query
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The Collector tree is fairly straightforward, showing how a single CancellableCollector wraps a MultiCollector
 which also wraps a FilteredCollector to execute the post_filter (and in turn wraps the normal scoring SimpleCollector),
 a BucketCollector to run all scoped aggregations.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>A special note needs to be made about the <code class="literal">MultiTermQuery</code> class of queries.  This includes wildcards, regex, and fuzzy
queries.  These queries emit very verbose responses, and are not overly structured.</p>
<p>Essentially, these queries rewrite themselves on a per-segment basis.  If you imagine the wildcard query <code class="literal">b*</code>, it technically
can match any token that begins with the letter "b".  It would be impossible to enumerate all possible combinations,
so Lucene rewrites the query in context of the segment being evaluated, e.g., one segment may contain the tokens
<code class="literal">[bar, baz]</code>, so the query rewrites to a BooleanQuery combination of "bar" and "baz".  Another segment may only have the
token <code class="literal">[bakery]</code>, so the query rewrites to a single TermQuery for "bakery".</p>
<p>Due to this dynamic, per-segment rewriting, the clean tree structure becomes distorted and no longer follows a clean
"lineage" showing how one query rewrites into the next.  At present time, all we can do is apologize, and suggest you
collapse the details for that query&#8217;s children if it is too confusing.  Luckily, all the timing statistics are correct,
just not the physical layout in the response, so it is sufficient to just analyze the top-level MultiTermQuery and
ignore its children if you find the details too tricky to interpret.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will be fixed in future iterations, but it is a tricky problem to solve and still in-progress :)</p>
