<p>Clusters that are actively using cross-cluster replication require a careful approach to upgrades.
The following conditions could cause index following to fail during rolling
upgrades:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Clusters that have not yet been upgraded will reject new index settings or
mapping types that are replicated from an upgraded cluster.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Nodes in a cluster that has not been upgraded will reject index files from a
node in an upgraded cluster when index following tries to fall back to
file-based recovery. This limitation is due to Lucene not being forward
compatible.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The approach to running a rolling upgrade on clusters where cross-cluster replication is
enabled differs based on uni-directional and bi-directional index following.</p>

<h3 class="title"><a id="ccr-uni-directional-upgrade"></a>Uni-directional index following<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.10/docs/reference/ccr/upgrading.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
</div></div></div>
<p>In a uni-directional configuration, one cluster contains only
leader indices, and the other cluster contains only follower indices that
replicate the leader indices.</p>
<p>In this strategy, the cluster with follower indices should be upgraded
first and the cluster with leader indices should be upgraded last.
Upgrading the clusters in this order ensures that index following can continue
during the upgrade without downtime.</p>
<p>You can also use this strategy to upgrade a
<a class="xref" href="xpack-ccr.html#ccr-chained-replication" title="Chained replication">replication chain</a>. Start by upgrading clusters at
the end of the chain and working your way back to the cluster that contains the
leader indices.</p>
<p>For example, consider a configuration where Cluster A contains all leader
indices. Cluster B follows indices in Cluster A, and Cluster C follows indices
in Cluster B.</p>
<pre class="literallayout">Cluster A
        ^--Cluster B
                   ^--Cluster C</pre>

<p>In this configuration, upgrade the clusters in the following order:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Cluster C
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Cluster B
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Cluster A
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

</div></div></div>
<p>In a bi-directional configuration, each cluster contains both leader and
follower indices.</p>
<p>When upgrading clusters in this configuration,
<a class="xref" href="ccr-managing.html#ccr-pause-replication" title="Pause and resume replication">pause all index following</a> and
<a class="xref" href="ccr-auto-follow.html#ccr-auto-follow-pause" title="Pause and resume auto-follow patterns">pause auto-follow patterns</a> prior to
upgrading both clusters.</p>
<p>After upgrading both clusters, resume index following and resume replication
of auto-follow patterns.</p>
