<p>Collectively, we have a lot of experience with users suffering
unexpected issues because they have not configured
<a class="xref" href="important-settings.html" title="Important Elasticsearch configuration">important settings</a>. In previous versions of
Elasticsearch, misconfiguration of some of these settings were logged
as warnings. Understandably, users sometimes miss these log messages.
To ensure that these settings receive the attention that they deserve,
Elasticsearch has bootstrap checks upon startup.</p>
<p>These bootstrap checks inspect a variety of Elasticsearch and system
settings and compare them to values that are safe for the operation of
Elasticsearch. If Elasticsearch is in development mode, any bootstrap
checks that fail appear as warnings in the Elasticsearch log. If
Elasticsearch is in production mode, any bootstrap checks that fail will
cause Elasticsearch to refuse to start.</p>
<p>There are some bootstrap checks that are always enforced to prevent
Elasticsearch from running with incompatible settings. These checks are
documented individually.</p>
<h3><a id="dev-vs-prod-mode"></a>Development vs. production mode<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.11/docs/reference/setup/bootstrap-checks.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>By default, Elasticsearch binds to loopback addresses for <a class="xref" href="modules-http.html" title="HTTP">HTTP</a>
and <a class="xref" href="modules-transport.html" title="Transport">transport (internal)</a> communication. This is fine for
downloading and playing with Elasticsearch as well as everyday development, but
it&#8217;s useless for production systems. To join a cluster, an Elasticsearch node
must be reachable via transport communication. To join a cluster via a
non-loopback address, a node must bind transport to a non-loopback address and
not be using <a class="xref" href="bootstrap-checks.html#single-node-discovery" title="Single-node discovery">single-node discovery</a>. Thus, we consider
an Elasticsearch node to be in development mode if it can not form a cluster
with another machine via a non-loopback address, and is otherwise in production
mode if it can join a cluster via non-loopback addresses.</p>
<p>Note that HTTP and transport can be configured independently via
<a class="xref" href="modules-http.html" title="HTTP"><code class="literal">http.host</code></a> and <a class="xref" href="modules-transport.html" title="Transport"><code class="literal">transport.host</code></a>; this
can be useful for configuring a single node to be reachable via HTTP for testing
purposes without triggering production mode.</p>
<h3><a id="single-node-discovery"></a>Single-node discovery<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.11/docs/reference/setup/bootstrap-checks.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>We recognize that some users need to bind transport to an external interface for
testing their usage of the transport client. For this situation, we provide the
discovery type <code class="literal">single-node</code> (configure it by setting <code class="literal">discovery.type</code> to
<code class="literal">single-node</code>); in this situation, a node will elect itself master and will not
join a cluster with any other node.</p>
<h3><a id="_forcing_the_bootstrap_checks"></a>Forcing the bootstrap checks<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.11/docs/reference/setup/bootstrap-checks.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If you are running a single node in production, it is possible to evade the
bootstrap checks (either by not binding transport to an external interface, or
by binding transport to an external interface and setting the discovery type to
<code class="literal">single-node</code>). For this situation, you can force execution of the bootstrap
checks by setting the system property <code class="literal">es.enforce.bootstrap.checks</code> to <code class="literal">true</code>
(set this in <a class="xref" href="jvm-options.html" title="Setting JVM options">Setting JVM options</a>, or by adding <code class="literal">-Des.enforce.bootstrap.checks=true</code>
to the environment variable <code class="literal">ES_JAVA_OPTS</code>). We strongly encourage you to do
this if you are in this specific situation. This system property can be used to
force execution of the bootstrap checks independent of the node configuration.</p>
