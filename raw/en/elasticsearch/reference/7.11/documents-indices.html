<p>Elasticsearch is a distributed document store. Instead of storing information as rows of
columnar data, Elasticsearch stores complex data structures that have been serialized
as JSON documents. When you have multiple Elasticsearch nodes in a cluster, stored
documents are distributed across the cluster and can be accessed immediately
from any node.</p>
<p>When a document is stored, it is indexed and fully searchable in <a class="xref" href="near-real-time.html" title="Near real-time search">near real-time</a>--within 1 second. Elasticsearch uses a data structure called an
inverted index that supports very fast full-text searches. An inverted index
lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all of the
documents each word occurs in.</p>
<p>An index can be thought of as an optimized collection of documents and each
document is a collection of fields, which are the key-value pairs that contain
your data. By default, Elasticsearch indexes all data in every field and each indexed
field has a dedicated, optimized data structure. For example, text fields are
stored in inverted indices, and numeric and geo fields are stored in BKD trees.
The ability to use the per-field data structures to assemble and return search
results is what makes Elasticsearch so fast.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch also has the ability to be schema-less, which means that documents can be
indexed without explicitly specifying how to handle each of the different fields
that might occur in a document. When dynamic mapping is enabled, Elasticsearch
automatically detects and adds new fields to the index. This default
behavior makes it easy to index and explore your data&#8212;&#8203;just start
indexing documents and Elasticsearch will detect and map booleans, floating point and
integer values, dates, and strings to the appropriate Elasticsearch data types.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, you know more about your data and how you want to use it
than Elasticsearch can. You can define rules to control dynamic mapping and explicitly
define mappings to take full control of how fields are stored and indexed.</p>
<p>Defining your own mappings enables you to:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Distinguish between full-text string fields and exact value string fields
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Perform language-specific text analysis
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Optimize fields for partial matching
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Use custom date formats
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Use data types such as <code class="literal">geo_point</code> and <code class="literal">geo_shape</code> that cannot be automatically
detected
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>It’s often useful to index the same field in different ways for different
purposes. For example, you might want to index a string field as both a text
field for full-text search and as a keyword field for sorting or aggregating
your data. Or, you might choose to use more than one language analyzer to
process the contents of a string field that contains user input.</p>
<p>The analysis chain that is applied to a full-text field during indexing is also
used at search time. When you query a full-text field, the query text undergoes
the same analysis before the terms are looked up in the index.</p>
