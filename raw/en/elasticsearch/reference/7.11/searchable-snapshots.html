<p>Searchable snapshots let you reduce your operating costs by using
<a class="xref" href="snapshot-restore.html" title="Snapshot and restore">snapshots</a> for resiliency rather than maintaining
<a class="xref" href="scalability.html" title="Scalability and resilience: clusters, nodes, and shards">replica shards</a> within a cluster. When you mount an index from a
snapshot as a searchable snapshot, Elasticsearch copies the index shards to local storage
within the cluster. This ensures that search performance is comparable to
searching any other index, and minimizes the need to access the snapshot
repository. Should a node fail, shards of a searchable snapshot index are
automatically recovered from the snapshot repository.</p>
<p>This can result in significant cost savings for less frequently searched data.
With searchable snapshots, you no longer need an extra index shard copy to avoid data
loss, potentially halving the node local storage capacity necessary for
searching that data. Because searchable snapshots rely on the same snapshot mechanism
you use for backups, they have a minimal impact on your snapshot repository
storage costs.</p>
<h3><a id="using-searchable-snapshots"></a>Using searchable snapshots<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.11/docs/reference/searchable-snapshots/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Searching a searchable snapshot index is the same as searching any other index.
Search performance is comparable to regular indices because the shard data is
copied onto nodes in the cluster when the searchable snapshot is mounted.</p>
<p>By default, searchable snapshot indices have no replicas. The underlying snapshot
provides resilience and the query volume is expected to be low enough that a
single shard copy will be sufficient. However, if you need to support a higher
query volume, you can add replicas by adjusting the <code class="literal">index.number_of_replicas</code>
index setting.</p>
<p>If a node fails and searchable snapshot shards need to be restored from the snapshot,
there is a brief window of time while Elasticsearch allocates the shards to other nodes
where the cluster health will not be <code class="literal">green</code>. Searches that hit these shards
will fail or return partial results until the shards are reallocated to healthy
nodes.</p>
<p>You typically manage searchable snapshots through ILM. The
<a class="xref" href="ilm-searchable-snapshot.html" title="Searchable snapshot">searchable snapshots</a> action automatically converts
a regular index into a searchable snapshot index when it reaches the <code class="literal">cold</code> phase.
You can also make indices in existing snapshots searchable by manually mounting
them as searchable snapshot indices with the
<a class="xref" href="searchable-snapshots-api-mount-snapshot.html" title="Mount snapshot API">mount snapshot</a> API.</p>
<p>To mount an index from a snapshot that contains multiple indices, we recommend
creating a <a class="xref" href="clone-snapshot-api.html" title="Clone snapshot API">clone</a> of the snapshot that contains only the
index you want to search, and mounting the clone. You should not delete a
snapshot if it has any mounted indices, so creating a clone enables you to
manage the lifecycle of the backup snapshot independently of any
searchable snapshots.</p>
<p>You can control the allocation of the shards of searchable snapshot indices using the
same mechanisms as for regular indices. For example, you could use
<a class="xref" href="shard-allocation-filtering.html" title="Index-level shard allocation filtering">Index-level shard allocation filtering</a> to restrict searchable snapshot shards to a subset of
your nodes.</p>
<p>We recommend that you <a class="xref" href="indices-forcemerge.html" title="Force merge API">force-merge</a> indices to a single
segment per shard before taking a snapshot that will be mounted as a
searchable snapshot index. Each read from a snapshot repository takes time and costs
money, and the fewer segments there are the fewer reads are needed to restore
the snapshot.</p>

<p>Searchable snapshots are ideal for managing a large archive of historical data.
Historical information is typically searched less frequently than recent data
and therefore may not need replicas for their performance benefits.</p>

<p><a id="searchable-snapshots-repository-types"></a>You can use any of the following repository types with searchable snapshots:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">

<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/7.11/repository-s3.html" class="ulink" target="_top">AWS S3</a>

<a class="xref" href="snapshots-register-repository.html#snapshots-filesystem-repository" title="Shared file system repository">Shared filesystems</a> such as NFS
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You can also use alternative implementations of these repository types, for

<h3><a id="how-searchable-snapshots-work"></a>How searchable snapshots work<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.11/docs/reference/searchable-snapshots/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When an index is mounted from a snapshot, Elasticsearch allocates its shards to data
nodes within the cluster. The data nodes then automatically restore the shard
data from the repository onto local storage. Once the restore process
completes, these shards respond to searches using the data held in local
storage and do not need to access the repository. This avoids incurring the
cost or performance penalty associated with reading data from the repository.</p>
<p>If a node holding one of these shards fails, Elasticsearch automatically allocates it to
another node, and that node restores the shard data from the repository. No
replicas are needed, and no complicated monitoring or orchestration is
necessary to restore lost shards.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch restores searchable snapshot shards in the background and you can search them
even if they have not been fully restored. If a search hits a searchable snapshot
shard before it has been fully restored, Elasticsearch eagerly retrieves the data needed
for the search. If a shard is freshly allocated to a node and still warming up,
some searches will be slower. However, searches typically access a very small
fraction of the total shard data so the performance penalty is typically small.</p>
<p>Replicas of searchable snapshots shards are restored by copying data from the
snapshot repository. In contrast, replicas of regular indices are restored by
copying data from the primary.</p>
<h3><a id="searchable-snapshots-reliability"></a>Reliability of searchable snapshots<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.11/docs/reference/searchable-snapshots/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The sole copy of the data in a searchable snapshot index is the underlying snapshot,
stored in the repository. If the repository fails or corrupts the contents of
the snapshot then the data is lost. Although Elasticsearch may have made copies of the
data onto local storage, these copies may be incomplete and cannot be used to
recover any data after a repository failure. You must make sure that your
repository is reliable and protects against corruption of your data while it is
at rest in the repository.</p>
<p>The blob storage offered by all major public cloud providers typically offers
very good protection against data loss or corruption. If you manage your own
repository storage then you are responsible for its reliability.</p>
