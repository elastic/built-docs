<p>You can also analyse how expensive each component of your queries and
aggregations are using the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.12/search-profile.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Profile API</a>. This might
allow you to tune your queries to be less expensive, resulting in a positive
performance result and reduced load. Also note that Profile API payloads can be
easily visualised for better readability in the
<a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.12/xpack-profiler.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Search Profiler</a>, which is a Kibana dev tools
UI available in all X-Pack licenses, including the free X-Pack Basic license.</p>
<p>Some caveats to the Profile API are that:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
the Profile API as a debugging tool adds significant overhead to search execution and can also have a very verbose output
</li>
<li class="listitem">
given the added overhead, the resulting took times are not reliable indicators of actual took time, but can be used comparatively between clauses for relative timing differences
</li>
<li class="listitem">
the Profile API is best for exploring possible reasons behind the most costly clauses of a query but isn&#8217;t intended for accurately measuring absolute timings of each clause
</li>
</ul>
