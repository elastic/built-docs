<p>Each time a transform examines the source indices and creates or updates the
destination index, it generates a <em>checkpoint</em>.</p>
<p>If your transform runs only once, there is logically only one checkpoint. If
your transform runs continuously, however, it creates checkpoints as it
ingests and transforms new source data. The <code class="literal">sync</code> property of the transform
configures checkpointing by specifying a time field.</p>
<p>To create a checkpoint, the continuous transform:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Checks for changes to source indices.</p>
<p>Using a simple periodic timer, the transform checks for changes to the source
indices. This check is done based on the interval defined in the transform&#8217;s
<code class="literal">frequency</code> property.</p>
<p>If the source indices remain unchanged or if a checkpoint is already in progress
then it waits for the next timer.</p>
<p>If changes are found a checkpoint is created.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Identifies which entities and/or time buckets have changed.</p>
<p>The transform searches to see which entities or time buckets have changed
between the last and the new checkpoint. The transform uses the values to
synchronize the source and destination indices with fewer operations than a
full re-run.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Updates the destination index (the data frame) with the changes.</p>
<p>The transform applies changes related to either new or changed entities or
time buckets to the destination index. The set of changes can be paginated. The
transform performs a composite aggregation similarly to the batch transform
operation, however it also injects query filters based on the previous step to
reduce the amount of work. After all changes have been applied, the checkpoint is
complete.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>This checkpoint process involves both search and indexing activity on the
cluster. We have attempted to favor control over performance while developing
transforms. We decided it was preferable for the transform to take longer to
complete, rather than to finish quickly and take precedence in resource
consumption. That being said, the cluster still requires enough resources to
support both the composite aggregation search and the indexing of its results.</p>

<h4><a id="ml-transform-checkpoint-heuristics"></a>Change detection heuristics<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.14/docs/reference/transform/checkpoints.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>When the transform runs in continuous mode, it updates the documents in the
destination index as new data comes in. The transform uses a set of heuristics
called change detection to update the destination index with fewer operations.</p>
<p>In this example, the data is grouped by host names. Change detection detects
which host names have changed,  for example, host <code class="literal">A</code>, <code class="literal">C</code> and <code class="literal">G</code> and only
updates documents with those hosts but does not update documents that store
information about host <code class="literal">B</code>, <code class="literal">D</code>, or any other host that are not changed.</p>
<p>Another heuristic can be applied for time buckets when a <code class="literal">date_histogram</code> is
used to group by time buckets. Change detection detects which time buckets have
changed and only update those.</p>
<h4><a id="ml-transform-checkpoint-errors"></a>Error handling<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.14/docs/reference/transform/checkpoints.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Failures in transforms tend to be related to searching or indexing.
To increase the resiliency of transforms, the cursor positions of
the aggregated search and the changed entities search are tracked in memory and
persisted periodically.</p>
<p>Checkpoint failures can be categorized as follows:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Temporary failures: The checkpoint is retried. If 10 consecutive failures
occur, the transform has a failed status. For example, this situation might
occur when there are shard failures and queries return only partial results.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Irrecoverable failures: The transform immediately fails. For example, this
situation occurs when the source index is not found.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Adjustment failures: The transform retries with adjusted settings. For
example, if a parent circuit breaker memory errors occur during the composite
aggregation, the transform receives partial results. The aggregated search is
retried with a smaller number of buckets. This retry is performed at the
interval defined in the <code class="literal">frequency</code> property for the transform. If the search
is retried to the point where it reaches a minimal number of buckets, an
irrecoverable failure occurs.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If the node running the transforms fails, the transform restarts from the
most recent persisted cursor position. This recovery process might repeat some
of the work the transform had already done, but it ensures data consistency.</p>
