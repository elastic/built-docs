<p>The delete API allows to delete a JSON document from a specific
index based on its id. The following example deletes the JSON document
from an index called <code class="literal">twitter</code> with ID <code class="literal">1</code>:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">DELETE /twitter/_doc/1</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/72.console"></div>
<p>The result of the above delete operation is:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">{
    "_shards" : {
        "total" : 2,
        "failed" : 0,
        "successful" : 2
    },
    "_index" : "twitter",
    "_type" : "_doc",
    "_id" : "1",
    "_version" : 2,
    "_primary_term": 1,
    "_seq_no": 5,
    "result": "deleted"
}</pre>
</div>
<h3><a id="optimistic-concurrency-control-delete"></a>Optimistic concurrency control<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.2/docs/reference/docs/delete.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Delete operations can be made conditional and only be performed if the last
modification to the document was assigned the sequence number and primary
term specified by the <code class="literal">if_seq_no</code> and <code class="literal">if_primary_term</code> parameters. If a
mismatch is detected, the operation will result in a <code class="literal">VersionConflictException</code>
and a status code of 409. See <a class="xref" href="optimistic-concurrency-control.html" title="Optimistic concurrency control"><em>Optimistic concurrency control</em></a> for more details.</p>
<h3><a id="delete-versioning"></a>Versioning<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.2/docs/reference/docs/delete.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Each document indexed is versioned. When deleting a document, the <code class="literal">version</code> can
be specified to make sure the relevant document we are trying to delete is
actually being deleted and it has not changed in the meantime. Every write
operation executed on a document, deletes included, causes its version to be
incremented. The version number of a deleted document remains available for a
short time after deletion to allow for control of concurrent operations. The
length of time for which a deleted document&#8217;s version remains available is
determined by the <code class="literal">index.gc_deletes</code> index setting and defaults to 60 seconds.</p>
<h3><a id="delete-routing"></a>Routing<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.2/docs/reference/docs/delete.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When indexing using the ability to control the routing, in order to
delete a document, the routing value should also be provided. For
example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">DELETE /twitter/_doc/1?routing=kimchy</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/73.console"></div>
<p>The above will delete a tweet with id <code class="literal">1</code>, but will be routed based on the
user. Note that issuing a delete without the correct routing will cause the
document to not be deleted.</p>
<p>When the <code class="literal">_routing</code> mapping is set as <code class="literal">required</code> and no routing value is
specified, the delete API will throw a <code class="literal">RoutingMissingException</code> and reject
the request.</p>
<h3><a id="delete-index-creation"></a>Automatic index creation<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.2/docs/reference/docs/delete.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If an <a class="xref" href="docs-index_.html" title="Index API">external versioning variant</a> is used,
the delete operation automatically creates an index if it has not been
created before (check out the <a class="xref" href="indices-create-index.html" title="Create Index">create index API</a>
for manually creating an index).</p>
<h3><a id="delete-distributed"></a>Distributed<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.2/docs/reference/docs/delete.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The delete operation gets hashed into a specific shard id. It then gets
redirected into the primary shard within that id group, and replicated
(if needed) to shard replicas within that id group.</p>
<h3><a id="delete-wait-for-active-shards"></a>Wait For Active Shards<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.2/docs/reference/docs/delete.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When making delete requests, you can set the <code class="literal">wait_for_active_shards</code>
parameter to require a minimum number of shard copies to be active
before starting to process the delete request. See
<a class="xref" href="docs-index_.html#index-wait-for-active-shards" title="Wait For Active Shards">here</a> for further details and a usage
example.</p>
<h3><a id="delete-refresh"></a>Refresh<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.2/docs/reference/docs/delete.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Control when the changes made by this request are visible to search. See
<a class="xref" href="docs-refresh.html" title="?refresh"><em><code class="literal">?refresh</code></em></a>.</p>
<h3><a id="delete-timeout"></a>Timeout<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.2/docs/reference/docs/delete.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The primary shard assigned to perform the delete operation might not be
available when the delete operation is executed. Some reasons for this
might be that the primary shard is currently recovering from a store
or undergoing relocation. By default, the delete operation will wait on
the primary shard to become available for up to 1 minute before failing
and responding with an error. The <code class="literal">timeout</code> parameter can be used to
explicitly specify how long it waits. Here is an example of setting it
to 5 minutes:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">DELETE /twitter/_doc/1?timeout=5m</pre>
