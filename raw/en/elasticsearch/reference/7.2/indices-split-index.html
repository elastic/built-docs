<p>The split index API allows you to split an existing index into a new index,
where each original primary shard is split into two or more primary shards in
the new index.</p>
<p>The number of times the index can be split (and the number of shards that each
original shard can be split into) is determined by the
<code class="literal">index.number_of_routing_shards</code> setting. The number of routing shards
specifies the hashing space that is used internally to distribute documents
across shards with consistent hashing. For instance, a 5 shard index with
<code class="literal">number_of_routing_shards</code> set to <code class="literal">30</code> (<code class="literal">5 x 2 x 3</code>) could be split by a
factor of <code class="literal">2</code> or <code class="literal">3</code>.  In other words, it could be split as follows:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">5</code> &#8594; <code class="literal">10</code> &#8594; <code class="literal">30</code>  (split by 2, then by 3)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">5</code> &#8594; <code class="literal">15</code> &#8594; <code class="literal">30</code> (split by 3, then by 2)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">5</code> &#8594; <code class="literal">30</code> (split by 6)
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>While you can set the <code class="literal">index.number_of_routing_shards</code> setting explicitly at
index creation time, the default value depends upon the number of primary
shards in the original index.  The default is designed to allow you to split
by factors of 2 up to a maximum of 1024 shards.  However, the original number
of primary shards must taken into account.  For instance, an index created
with 5 primary shards could be split into 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, or a
maximum of 640 shards (with a single split action or multiple split actions).</p>
<p>If the original index contains one primary shard (or a multi-shard index has
been <a class="xref" href="indices-shrink-index.html" title="Shrink Index">shrunk</a> down to a single primary shard), then the
index may by split into an arbitrary number of shards greater than 1.  The
properties of the default number of routing shards will then apply to the
newly split index.</p>

<p>Splitting works as follows:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
First, it creates a new target index with the same definition as the source
index, but with a larger number of primary shards.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Then it hard-links segments from the source index into the target index. (If
the file system doesn&#8217;t support hard-linking, then all segments are copied
into the new index, which is a much more time consuming process.)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Once the low level files are created all documents will be <code class="literal">hashed</code> again to delete
documents that belong to a different shard.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Finally, it recovers the target index as though it were a closed index which
had just been re-opened.
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="incremental-resharding"></a>Why doesn&#8217;t Elasticsearch support incremental resharding?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.2/docs/reference/indices/split-index.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Going from <code class="literal">N</code> shards to <code class="literal">N+1</code> shards, aka. incremental resharding, is indeed a
feature that is supported by many key-value stores. Adding a new shard and
pushing new data to this new shard only is not an option: this would likely be
an indexing bottleneck, and figuring out which shard a document belongs to
given its <code class="literal">_id</code>, which is necessary for get, delete and update requests, would
become quite complex. This means that we need to rebalance existing data using
a different hashing scheme.</p>
<p>The most common way that key-value stores do this efficiently is by using
consistent hashing. Consistent hashing only requires <code class="literal">1/N</code>-th of the keys to
be relocated when growing the number of shards from <code class="literal">N</code> to <code class="literal">N+1</code>. However
Elasticsearch&#8217;s unit of storage, shards, are Lucene indices. Because of their
search-oriented data structure, taking a significant portion of a Lucene index,
be it only 5% of documents, deleting them and indexing them on another shard
typically comes with a much higher cost than with a key-value store. This cost
is kept reasonable when growing the number of shards by a multiplicative factor
as described in the above section: this allows Elasticsearch to perform the
split locally, which in-turn allows to perform the split at the index level
rather than reindexing documents that need to move, as well as using hard links
for efficient file copying.</p>
<p>In the case of append-only data, it is possible to get more flexibility by
creating a new index and pushing new data to it, while adding an alias that
covers both the old and the new index for read operations. Assuming that the
old and new indices have respectively <code class="literal">M</code> and <code class="literal">N</code> shards, this has no overhead
compared to searching an index that would have <code class="literal">M+N</code> shards.</p>

<p>Create a new index:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT my_source_index

</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/600.console"></div>
<p>In order to split an index, the index must be marked as read-only,
and have <a class="xref" href="cluster-health.html" title="Cluster Health">health</a> <code class="literal">green</code>.</p>
<p>This can be achieved with the following request:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT /my_source_index/_settings

<p>The split process can be monitored with the <a class="xref" href="cat-recovery.html" title="cat recovery"><code class="literal">_cat recovery</code>
API</a>, or the <a class="xref" href="cluster-health.html" title="Cluster Health"><code class="literal">cluster health</code> API</a> can be used to wait
until all primary shards have been allocated by setting the  <code class="literal">wait_for_status</code>
parameter to <code class="literal">yellow</code>.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">_split</code> API returns as soon as the target index has been added to the
cluster state, before any shards have been allocated. At this point, all
shards are in the state <code class="literal">unassigned</code>. If, for any reason, the target index
can&#8217;t be allocated, its primary shard will remain <code class="literal">unassigned</code> until it
can be allocated on that node.</p>
<p>Once the primary shard is allocated, it moves to state <code class="literal">initializing</code>, and the
split process begins. When the split operation completes, the shard will
become <code class="literal">active</code>. At that  point, Elasticsearch will try to allocate any
replicas and may decide to relocate the primary shard to another node.</p>

<p>Because the split operation creates a new index to split the shards to,
the <a class="xref" href="indices-create-index.html#create-index-wait-for-active-shards" title="Wait For Active Shards">wait for active shards</a> setting
on index creation applies to the split index action as well.</p>
