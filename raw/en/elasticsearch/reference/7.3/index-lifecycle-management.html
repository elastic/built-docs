<p>The <a class="xref" href="index-lifecycle-management-api.html" title="Index lifecycle management API">index lifecycle management (ILM) APIs</a> enable you to
automate how you want to manage your indices over time. Rather than simply
performing management actions on your indices on a set schedule, you can base
actions on other factors such as shard size and performance requirements.</p>
<p>You control how indices are handled as they age by attaching a
lifecycle policy to the index template used to create them. You can update
the policy to modify the lifecycle of both new and existing indices.</p>
<p>For time series indices, there are four stages in the index lifecycle:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Hot&#8212;&#8203;the index is actively being updated and queried.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Warm&#8212;&#8203;the index is no longer being updated, but is still being queried.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Cold&#8212;&#8203;the index is no longer being updated and is seldom queried. The
information still needs to be searchable, but it&#8217;s okay if those queries are
slower.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Delete&#8212;&#8203;the index is no longer needed and can safely be deleted.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The lifecycle policy governs how the index transitions through these stages and
the actions that are performed on the index at each stage. The policy can
specify:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The maximum size or age at which you want to roll over to a new index.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The point at which the index is no longer being updated and the number of
primary shards can be reduced.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
When to force a merge to permanently delete documents marked for deletion.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The point at which the index can be moved to less performant hardware.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The point at which the availability is not as critical and the number of
replicas can be reduced.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
When the index can be safely deleted.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For example, if you are indexing metrics data from a fleet of ATMs into
Elasticsearch, you might define a policy that says:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
When the index reaches 50GB, roll over to a new index.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Move the old index into the warm stage, mark it read only, and shrink it down
to a single shard.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
After 7 days, move the index into the cold stage and move it to less expensive
hardware.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Delete the index once the required 30 day retention period is reached.
</li>
</ol>

<p>index lifecycle management does not support mixed-version cluster usage. Although it
may be possible to create such new policies against
newer-versioned nodes, there is no guarantee they will
work as intended. New policies using new actions that
do not exist in the oldest versioned node will cause errors.</p>
