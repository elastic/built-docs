<p>Elasticsearch can read indices created in the previous major version. If you
have indices created in 5.x or before, you must reindex or delete them
before upgrading to 7.4.2. Elasticsearch nodes will fail to start if
incompatible indices are present. Snapshots of 5.x or earlier indices cannot be
restored to a 7.x cluster even if they were created by a 6.x cluster.</p>
<p>This restriction also applies to the internal indices that are used by
Kibana and the X-Pack features. Therefore, before you can use Kibana and
X-Pack features in 7.4.2, you must ensure the internal indices have a
compatible index structure.</p>
<p>You have two options for reindexing old indices:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="reindex-upgrade-inplace.html" title="Reindex in place">Reindex in place</a> on your 6.x cluster before upgrading.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Create a new 7.4.2 cluster and <a class="xref" href="reindex-upgrade-remote.html" title="Reindex from a remote cluster">Reindex from remote</a>.
This enables you to reindex indices that reside on clusters running any version of Elasticsearch.

</ul>

<p>If you use time-based indices, you likely won&#8217;t need to carry
pre-6.x indices forward to 7.4.2. Data in time-based indices
generally becomes less useful as time passes and are
deleted as they age past your retention period.</p>
<p>Unless you have an unusually long retention period, you can just
wait to upgrade to 6.x until all of your pre-6.x indices have
been deleted.</p>
