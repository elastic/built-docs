<p>A new <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/modules-node.html#voting-only-node" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">node.voting-only</code></a> role has been
introduced that allows nodes to participate in elections even though they are
not eligible to become the master.
The benefit is that these nodes still help with high availability while
requiring less CPU and heap than master nodes.</p>

<p>A new <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/indices-reload-analyzers.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Analyzer reload API</a> allows to reload
the definition of search-time analyzers and their associated resources. A common
use-case for this API is the reloading of search-time synonyms. In earlier
versions of Elasticsearch, users could force synonyms to be reloaded by closing
the index and then opening it again. With this new API, synonyms can be updated
without closing the index.</p>

This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
</span>
</span> <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/transforms.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Transforms</a> are a core new
feature in Elasticsearch that enable you to transform an existing index to a secondary,
summarized index. Transforms enable you to pivot your data and
create entity-centric indices that can summarize the behavior of an entity. This
organizes the data into an analysis-friendly format.</p>
<p>Transforms were originally available in 7.2. With 7.3 they can
now run either as a single batch transform or continuously incorporating new
data as it is ingested.</p>
<p>Data frames enable new possibilities for machine learning analysis (such as
<em>outlier detection</em>), but they can also be useful for other types of
visualizations and custom types of analysis.</p>
<h4><a id="release-highlights-7.3.0-outlier-detection"></a>Discover your most unusual data using outlier detection<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.5/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-7.3.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The goal of <a href="/guide/en/machine-learning/7.5/dfa-outlier-detection.html" class="ulink" target="_top">outlier detection</a> is to find
the most unusual data points in an index. We analyse the numerical fields of
each data point (document in an index) and annotate them with how unusual they
are.</p>
<p>We use unsupervised outlier detection which means there is no need to provide a
training data set to teach outlier detection to recognize outliers. In practice,
this is achieved by using an ensemble of distance based and density based
techniques to identify those data points which are the most different from the
bulk of the data in the index. We assign to each analysed data point an
outlier score, which captures how different the entity is from other entities in the
index.</p>
<p>In addition to new outlier detection functionality, we are introducing the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/evaluate-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">evaluate data frame analytics API</a>, which enables you
to compute a range of performance metrics such
as confusion matrices, precision, recall, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic" class="ulink" target="_top">receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve</a>
and the area under the ROC curve. If you are running outlier detection on a source
index that has already been labeled to indicate which points are truly outliers
and which are normal, you can use the
evaluate data frame analytics API to assess the performance of the
outlier detection analytics on your dataset.</p>
