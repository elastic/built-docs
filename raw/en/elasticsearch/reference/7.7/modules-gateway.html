<p>The local gateway stores the cluster state and shard data across full
cluster restarts.</p>
<p>The following <em>static</em> settings, which must be set on every master node,
control how long a freshly elected master should wait before it tries to
recover the cluster state and the cluster&#8217;s data:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">

The number of (data or master) nodes that are expected to be in the cluster.
Recovery of local shards will start as soon as the expected number of
nodes have joined the cluster. Defaults to <code class="literal">0</code>

<p>When a node joins the cluster, any shards stored in its local data
directory which do not already exist in the cluster will be imported into the
cluster. This functionality is intended as a best effort to help users who
lose all master nodes. If a new master node is started which is unaware of
the other indices in the cluster, adding the old nodes will cause the old
indices to be imported, instead of being deleted.</p>
