<p>A repository can contain multiple snapshots of the same cluster. Snapshots are identified by unique names within the
cluster. A snapshot with the name <code class="literal">snapshot_1</code> in the repository <code class="literal">my_backup</code> can be created by executing the following
command:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1?wait_for_completion=true</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1192.console"></div>
<p>The <code class="literal">wait_for_completion</code> parameter specifies whether or not the request should return immediately after snapshot
initialization (default) or wait for snapshot completion. During snapshot initialization, information about all
previous snapshots is loaded into the memory, which means that in large repositories it may take several seconds (or
even minutes) for this command to return even if the <code class="literal">wait_for_completion</code> parameter is set to <code class="literal">false</code>.</p>
<p>By default a snapshot of all open and started indices in the cluster is created. This behavior can be changed by
specifying the list of indices in the body of the snapshot request.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_2?wait_for_completion=true
{
  "indices": "index_1,index_2",
  "ignore_unavailable": true,
  "include_global_state": false,
  "metadata": {
    "taken_by": "kimchy",
    "taken_because": "backup before upgrading"
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1193.console"></div>
<p>The list of indices that should be included into the snapshot can be specified using the <code class="literal">indices</code> parameter that
supports <a class="xref" href="multi-index.html" title="Multiple indices">multi index syntax</a>, although the options which control the behavior of multi index syntax
must be supplied in the body of the request, rather than as request parameters. The snapshot request also supports the
<code class="literal">ignore_unavailable</code> option. Setting it to <code class="literal">true</code> will cause indices that do not exist to be ignored during snapshot
creation. By default, when <code class="literal">ignore_unavailable</code> option is not set and an index is missing the snapshot request will fail.
By setting <code class="literal">include_global_state</code> to false it&#8217;s possible to prevent the cluster global state to be stored as part of
the snapshot. By default, the entire snapshot will fail if one or more indices participating in the snapshot don&#8217;t have
all primary shards available. This behaviour can be changed by setting <code class="literal">partial</code> to <code class="literal">true</code>. The <code class="literal">expand_wildcards</code>
option can be used to control whether hidden and closed indices will be included in the snapshot, and defaults to <code class="literal">all</code>.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">metadata</code> field can be used to attach arbitrary metadata to the snapshot. This may be a record of who took the snapshot,
why it was taken, or any other data that might be useful.</p>
<p>Snapshot names can be automatically derived using <a class="xref" href="date-math-index-names.html" title="Date math support in index names">date math expressions</a>, similarly as when creating
new indices. Note that special characters need to be URI encoded.</p>
<p>For example, creating a snapshot with the current day in the name, like <code class="literal">snapshot-2018.05.11</code>, can be achieved with
the following command:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console"># PUT /_snapshot/my_backup/&lt;snapshot-{now/d}&gt;
PUT /_snapshot/my_backup/%3Csnapshot-%7Bnow%2Fd%7D%3E</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1194.console"></div>
<p>The index snapshot process is incremental. In the process of making the index snapshot Elasticsearch analyses
the list of the index files that are already stored in the repository and copies only files that were created or
changed since the last snapshot. That allows multiple snapshots to be preserved in the repository in a compact form.
Snapshotting process is executed in non-blocking fashion. All indexing and searching operation can continue to be
executed against the index that is being snapshotted. However, a snapshot represents the point-in-time view of the index
at the moment when snapshot was created, so no records that were added to the index after the snapshot process was started
will be present in the snapshot. The snapshot process starts immediately for the primary shards that has been started
and are not relocating at the moment. Before version 1.2.0, the snapshot operation fails if the cluster has any relocating or
initializing primaries of indices participating in the snapshot. Starting with version 1.2.0, Elasticsearch waits for
relocation or initialization of shards to complete before snapshotting them.</p>
<p>Besides creating a copy of each index the snapshot process can also store global cluster metadata, which includes persistent
cluster settings and templates. The transient settings and registered snapshot repositories are not stored as part of
the snapshot.</p>
<p>Only one snapshot process can be executed in the cluster at any time. While snapshot of a particular shard is being
created this shard cannot be moved to another node, which can interfere with rebalancing process and allocation
filtering. Elasticsearch will only be able to move a shard to another node (according to the current allocation
filtering settings and rebalancing algorithm) once the snapshot is finished.</p>
<p>Once a snapshot is created information about this snapshot can be obtained using the following command:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1195.console"></div>
<p>This command returns basic information about the snapshot including start and end time, version of
Elasticsearch that created the snapshot, the list of included indices, the current state of the
snapshot and the list of failures that occurred during the snapshot. The snapshot <code class="literal">state</code> can be</p>
<div class="informaltable">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4px">
<colgroup>
<col/>
<col/>
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<p>
<code class="literal">IN_PROGRESS</code>
</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<p>

</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<p>

</tr>

</td>

</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<p>
The global cluster state was stored, but data of at least one shard wasn&#8217;t stored successfully.
The <code class="literal">failure</code> section in this case should contain more detailed information about shards
that were not processed correctly.

<p>
<code class="literal">INCOMPATIBLE</code>

</div>
<p>Similar as for repositories, information about multiple snapshots can be queried in one go, supporting wildcards as well:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_*,some_other_snapshot</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1196.console"></div>
<p>All snapshots currently stored in the repository can be listed using the following command:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET /_snapshot/my_backup/_all</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1197.console"></div>
<p>The command fails if some of the snapshots are unavailable. The boolean parameter <code class="literal">ignore_unavailable</code> can be used to
return all snapshots that are currently available.</p>
<p>Getting all snapshots in the repository can be costly on cloud-based repositories,
both from a cost and performance perspective.  If the only information required is
the snapshot names/uuids in the repository and the indices in each snapshot, then
the optional boolean parameter <code class="literal">verbose</code> can be set to <code class="literal">false</code> to execute a more
performant and cost-effective retrieval of the snapshots in the repository.  Note
that setting <code class="literal">verbose</code> to <code class="literal">false</code> will omit all other information about the snapshot
such as status information, the number of snapshotted shards, etc.  The default
value of the <code class="literal">verbose</code> parameter is <code class="literal">true</code>.</p>
<p>It is also possible to retrieve snapshots from multiple repositories in one go, for example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET /_snapshot/_all
GET /_snapshot/my_backup,my_fs_backup
GET /_snapshot/my*/snap*</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1198.console"></div>
<p>A currently running snapshot can be retrieved using the following command:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET /_snapshot/my_backup/_current</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1199.console"></div>
<p>A snapshot can be deleted from the repository using the following command:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">DELETE /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_2</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1200.console"></div>
<p>When a snapshot is deleted from a repository, Elasticsearch deletes all files that are associated with the deleted
snapshot and not used by any other snapshots. If the deleted snapshot operation is executed while the snapshot is being
created the snapshotting process will be aborted and all files created as part of the snapshotting process will be
cleaned. Therefore, the delete snapshot operation can be used to cancel long running snapshot operations that were
started by mistake.</p>
