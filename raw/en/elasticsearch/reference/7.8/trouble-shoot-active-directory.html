<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Resolution:</strong></span></p>
<p>Check your realm configuration; realms are checked serially, one after another.
If your Active Directory realm is being checked before other realms and there
are usernames that appear in both Active Directory and another realm, a valid
login for one realm might be causing failed login attempts in another realm.</p>
<p>For example, if <code class="literal">UserA</code> exists in both Active Directory and a file realm, and
the Active Directory realm is checked first and file is checked second, an
attempt to authenticate as <code class="literal">UserA</code> in the file realm would first attempt to
authenticate against Active Directory and fail, before successfully
authenticating against the <code class="literal">file</code> realm. Because authentication is verified on
each request, the Active Directory realm would be checked - and fail - on each
request for <code class="literal">UserA</code> in the <code class="literal">file</code> realm. In this case, while the authentication
request completed successfully, the account on Active Directory would have
received several failed login attempts, and that account might become
temporarily locked out. Plan the order of your realms accordingly.</p>
<p>Also note that it is not typically necessary to define multiple Active Directory
realms to handle domain controller failures. When using Microsoft DNS, the DNS
entry for the domain should always point to an available domain controller.</p>
