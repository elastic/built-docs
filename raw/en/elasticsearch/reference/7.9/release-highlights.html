<p>When indexing data, Elasticsearch and Lucene use heap memory for buffering. To control memory usage, Elasticsearch moves data from the
buffer to disk based on your <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/indexing-buffer.html" class="ulink" target="_top">indexing buffer settings</a>. If ongoing indexing  outpaces the
relocation of data to disk, Elasticsearch will now throttle indexing. In previous Elasticsearch versions, this feature was broken and
throttling was not activated.</p>
<h3><a id="_eql"></a>EQL<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.9/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>EQL (Event Query Language) is a declarative language dedicated for identifying patterns and relationships between events.</p>
<p>Consider using EQL if you:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Use Elasticsearch for threat hunting or other security use cases
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Search time series data or logs, such as network or system logs
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Want an easy way to explore relationships between events
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>A good intro on EQL and its purpose is available
<a href="/blog/introducing-event-query-language" class="ulink" target="_top">in this blog
post</a>. See the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/eql.html" class="ulink" target="_top">EQL in Elasticsearch</a> documentaton for an in-depth
explanation, and also the
<a href="https://eql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/query-guide/index.html" class="ulink" target="_top">language
reference</a>.</p>
<p>This release includes the following features:</p>

<p>A <em>data stream</em> is a convenient, scalable way to ingest, search, and manage
continuously generated time series data. They provide a simpler way to split
data across multiple indices and still query it via a single named resource.</p>

<p>Snapshot operations can now execute in a fully concurrent manner.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">

<h3><a id="_improve_speed_and_memory_usage_of_multi_bucket_aggregations"></a>Improve speed and memory usage of multi-bucket aggregations<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.9/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Before 7.9, many of our more complex aggregations made a simplifying
assumption that required that they duplicate many data structures once per
bucket that contained them. The most expensive of these weighed in at a
couple of kilobytes each. So for an aggregation like:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">POST _search
{
  "aggs": {
    "date": {
      "date_histogram": { "field": "timestamp", "calendar_interval": "day" },
      "aggs": {
        "ips": {
          "terms": { "field": "ip" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1.console"></div>
<p>When run over three years, this aggregation spends a couple of megabytes
just on bucket accounting. More deeply nested aggregations spend even more
on this overhead. Elasticsearch 7.9 removes all of this overhead, which
should allow us to run better in lower memory environments.</p>
<p>As a bonus we wrote quite a few Rally benchmarks for aggregations to make
sure that these tests didn&#8217;t slow down aggregations, so now we can think
much more scientifically about aggregation performance. The benchmarks
suggest that these changes don&#8217;t affect simple aggregation trees and speed
up complex aggregation trees of similar or higher depth than the example
above. Your actual performance changes will vary but this optimization
should help!</p>
<h3><a id="_allow_index_filtering_in_field_capabilities_api"></a>Allow index filtering in field capabilities API<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.9/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You can now supply an <code class="literal">index_filter</code> to the <a class="xref" href="search-field-caps.html" title="Field capabilities API">field
capabilities API</a>. Indices are filtered from the response if the provided
query rewrites to <code class="literal">match_none</code> on every shard.</p>
<h3><a id="_support_terms_and_rare_terms_aggregations_in_transforms"></a>Support <code class="literal">terms</code> and <code class="literal">rare_terms</code> aggregations in transforms<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.9/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Transforms now support the <code class="literal">terms</code> and <code class="literal">rare_terms</code> aggregations. The
default behavior is that the results are collapsed in the following manner:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-txt">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-txt">&lt;AGG_NAME&gt;.&lt;BUCKET_NAME&gt;.&lt;SUBAGGS...&gt;...</pre>
</div>
<p>Or if no sub-aggregations exist:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-txt">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-txt">&lt;AGG_NAME&gt;.&lt;BUCKET_NAME&gt;.&lt;_doc_count&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>The mapping is also defined as <code class="literal">flattened</code> by default. This is to avoid
field explosion while still providing (limited) search and aggregation
capabilities.</p>
<h3><a id="_optimize_date_histograms_across_daylight_savings_time"></a>Optimize <code class="literal">date_histograms</code> across daylight savings time<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.9/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Rounding dates on a shard that contains a daylight savings time transition
is currently drastically slower than when a shard contains dates
only on one side of the DST transition, and also generates a large number
of short-lived objects in memory. Elasticsearch 7.9 has a revised and
far more efficient implemention that adds only a comparatively small
overhead to requests.</p>
<h3><a id="_improved_resilience_to_network_disruption"></a>Improved resilience to network disruption<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.9/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elasticsearch now has mechansisms to safely resume peer recoveries when there is
network disruption, which would previously have failed any in-progress peer
recoveries.</p>
<h3><a id="_wildcard_field_optimised_for_wildcard_queries"></a>Wildcard field optimised for wildcard queries<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.9/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elasticsearch now supports a <code class="literal">wildcard</code> field type, which stores values optimised
for wildcard grep-like queries. While such queries are possible with other
field types, they suffer from constraints that limit their usefulness.</p>
<p>This field type is especially well suited for running grep-like queries on
log lines. See the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/wildcard.html" class="ulink" target="_top">wildcard datatype</a> documentation for more
information.</p>
<h3><a id="_indexing_metrics_and_back_pressure"></a>Indexing metrics and back pressure<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.9/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elasticsearch 7.9 now tracks metrics about the number of indexing
request bytes that are outstanding at each point in the indexing process
(coordinating, primary, and replication). These metrics are exposed in the
node stats API. Additionally, the new setting
<code class="literal">indexing_pressure.memory.limit</code> controls the maximum number of bytes that
can be outstanding, which is 10% of the heap by default. Once this number
of bytes from a node&#8217;s heap is consumed by outstanding indexing bytes, Elasticsearch
will start rejecting new coordinating and primary requests.</p>
<p>Additionally, since a failed replication operation can fail a replica, Elasticsearch
will assign 1.5X limit for the number of replication bytes.
Only replication bytes can trigger this limit. If replication bytes
increase to high levels, the node will stop accepting new coordinating and
primary operations until the replication work load has dropped.</p>
<h3><a id="_inference_in_pipeline_aggregations"></a>Inference in pipeline aggregations<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.9/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In 7.6, we introduced <a href="/guide/en/machine-learning/7.9/ml-inference.html" class="ulink" target="_top">inference</a> that enables you to
make predictions on new data with your regression or classification models
via a processor in an ingest pipeline. Now, in 7.9, inference is even more
flexible! You can reference a pre-trained data frame analytics model in an
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-pipeline-inference-bucket-aggregation.html" class="ulink" target="_top">aggregation</a>
to infer on the result field of the parent bucket aggregation. The aggregation
uses the model on the results to provide a prediction. This addition enables you
to run classification or regression analysis at search time. If you want to
perform analysis on a small set of data, you can generate predictions without
the need to set up a processor in the ingest pipeline.</p>
