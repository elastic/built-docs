<p>The alerting features enable you to watch
for changes or anomalies in your data and perform the necessary actions in
response. For example, you might want to:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Monitor social media as another way to detect failures in user-facing
automated systems like ATMs or ticketing systems. When the number of tweets
and posts in an area exceeds a threshold of significance, notify a service
technician.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Monitor your infrastructure, tracking disk usage over time. Open a helpdesk
ticket when any servers are likely to run out of free space in the next few
days.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Track network activity to detect malicious activity, and proactively change
firewall configuration to reject the malicious user.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Monitor Elasticsearch, and send immediate notification to the system
administrator if nodes leave the cluster or query throughput exceeds an
expected range.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Track application response times and if page-load time exceeds SLAs for more
than 5 minutes, open a helpdesk ticket. If SLAs are exceeded for an hour,
page the administrator on duty.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>All of these use-cases share a few key properties:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The relevant data or changes in data can be identified with a periodic
Elasticsearch query.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The results of the query can be checked against a condition.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
One or more actions are taken if the condition is true&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;an email is sent, a
3rd party system is notified, or the query results are stored.
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="_how_watches_work"></a>How watches work<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.9/x-pack/docs/en/watcher/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The alerting features provide an API for creating, managing and testing <em>watches</em>.
A watch describes a single alert and can contain multiple notification actions.</p>
<p>A watch is constructed from four simple building blocks:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Schedule
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A schedule for running a query and checking the condition.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Query
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The query to run as input to the condition. Watches
support the full Elasticsearch query language, including
aggregations.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Condition
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A condition that determines whether or not to execute the actions.
You can use simple conditions (always true), or use scripting for
more sophisticated scenarios.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Actions
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
One or more actions, such as sending email, pushing data to
3rd party systems through a webhook, or indexing the results of
the query.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>A full history of all watches is maintained in an Elasticsearch index. This
history keeps track of each time a watch is triggered and records the results
from the query, whether the condition was met, and what actions were taken.</p>
