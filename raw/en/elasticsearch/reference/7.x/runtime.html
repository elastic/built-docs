<p>Typically, you index data into Elasticsearch to promote faster search. However, indexing
can be slow and requires more disk space, and you have to reindex your data to
add fields to existing documents. With <em>runtime fields</em>, you can add
fields to documents already indexed to Elasticsearch without reindexing your data.</p>
<p>You access runtime fields from the search API like any other field, and Elasticsearch
sees runtime fields no differently. You can define runtime fields in the
<a class="xref" href="runtime-mapping-fields.html" title="Mapping a runtime field">index mapping</a> or in the
<a class="xref" href="runtime-search-request.html" title="Defining runtime fields in a search request">search request</a>. Your choice, which is part of the
inherent flexibility of runtime fields.</p>
<h3><a id="runtime-benefits"></a>Benefits<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.x/docs/reference/mapping/runtime.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Because runtime fields aren&#8217;t indexed, adding a runtime field doesn&#8217;t increase
the index size. You define runtime fields directly in the index mapping, saving
storage costs and increasing ingestion speed. You can more quickly ingest
data into the Elastic Stack and access it right away. When you define a runtime
field, you can immediately use it in search requests, aggregations, filtering,
and sorting.</p>
<p>If you make a runtime field an indexed field, you don&#8217;t need to modify any
queries that refer to the runtime field. Better yet, you can refer to some
indices where the field is a runtime field, and other indices where the field
is an indexed field. You have the flexibility to choose which fields to index
and which ones to keep as runtime fields.</p>
<p>At its core, the most important benefit of runtime fields is the ability to
add fields to documents after you&#8217;ve ingested them. This capability simplifies
mapping decisions because you don&#8217;t have to decide how to parse your data up
front, and can use runtime fields to amend the mapping at any time. Using
runtime fields allows for a smaller index and faster ingest time, which
combined use less resources and reduce your operating costs.</p>
<h3><a id="runtime-use-cases"></a>Use cases<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.x/docs/reference/mapping/runtime.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Runtime fields are useful when working with log data
(see <a class="xref" href="runtime-examples.html" title="Runtime fields examples">examples</a>), especially when you&#8217;re unsure about the
data structure. Your search speed decreases, but your index size is much
smaller and you can more quickly process logs without having to index them.</p>
<p>Runtime fields are especially useful in the following contexts:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Adding fields to documents that are already indexed without having to reindex
data
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Immediately begin working on a new data stream without fully understanding
the data it contains
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Shadowing an indexed field with a runtime field to fix a mistake after
indexing documents
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Defining fields that are only relevant for a particular context (such as a
visualization in Kibana) without influencing the underlying schema
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="runtime-compromises"></a>Compromises<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.x/docs/reference/mapping/runtime.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Runtime fields use less disk space and provide flexibility in how you access
your data, but can impact search performance based on the computation defined in
the runtime script.</p>
<p>To balance search performance and flexibility, index fields that you&#8217;ll
frequently search for, aggregate and filter on, such as a timestamp. Elasticsearch automatically uses
these indexed fields first when running a query, resulting in a fast response
time. You can then use runtime fields to limit the number of fields that Elasticsearch
needs to calculate values for. Using indexed fields in tandem with runtime
fields provides flexibility in the data that you index and how you define
queries for other fields.</p>
<p>Use the <a class="xref" href="async-search.html" title="Async search">asynchronous search API</a> to run searches that include
runtime fields. This method of search helps to offset the performance impacts
of computing values for runtime fields in each document containing that field.
If the query can&#8217;t return the result set synchronously, you&#8217;ll get results
asynchronously as they become available.</p>

<p>Queries against runtime fields are considered expensive. If
<a class="xref" href="query-dsl.html#query-dsl-allow-expensive-queries"><code class="literal">search.allow_expensive_queries</code></a> is set
to <code class="literal">false</code>, expensive queries are not allowed and Elasticsearch will reject any queries
against runtime fields.</p>
