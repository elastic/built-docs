<h3><a id="_give_memory_to_the_filesystem_cache_2"></a>Give memory to the filesystem cache<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.0/docs/reference/how-to/search-speed.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elasticsearch heavily relies on the filesystem cache in order to make search
fast. In general, you should make sure that at least half the available memory
goes to the filesystem cache so that Elasticsearch can keep hot regions of the
index in physical memory.</p>
<h3><a id="_use_faster_hardware_2"></a>Use faster hardware<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.0/docs/reference/how-to/search-speed.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If your search is I/O bound, you should investigate giving more memory to the
filesystem cache (see above) or buying faster drives. In particular SSD drives
are known to perform better than spinning disks. Always use local storage,
remote filesystems such as <code class="literal">NFS</code> or <code class="literal">SMB</code> should be avoided. Also beware of
virtualized storage such as Amazon&#8217;s <code class="literal">Elastic Block Storage</code>. Virtualized
storage works very well with Elasticsearch, and it is appealing since it is so
fast and simple to set up, but it is also unfortunately inherently slower on an
ongoing basis when compared to dedicated local storage. If you put an index on
<code class="literal">EBS</code>, be sure to use provisioned IOPS otherwise operations could be quickly
throttled.</p>
<p>If your search is CPU-bound, you should investigate buying faster CPUs.</p>
<h3><a id="_document_modeling"></a>Document modeling<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.0/docs/reference/how-to/search-speed.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Documents should be modeled so that search-time operations are as cheap as possible.</p>
<p>In particular, joins should be avoided. <a class="xref" href="nested.html" title="Nested field type"><code class="literal">nested</code></a> can make queries
several times slower and <a class="xref" href="parent-join.html" title="Join field type">parent-child</a> relations can make
queries hundreds of times slower. So if the same questions can be answered without
joins by denormalizing documents, significant speedups can be expected.</p>
<h3><a id="search-as-few-fields-as-possible"></a>Search as few fields as possible<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.0/docs/reference/how-to/search-speed.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The more fields a <a class="xref" href="query-dsl-query-string-query.html" title="Query string query"><code class="literal">query_string</code></a> or
<a class="xref" href="query-dsl-multi-match-query.html" title="Multi-match query"><code class="literal">multi_match</code></a> query targets, the slower it is.
A common technique to improve search speed over multiple fields is to copy
their values into a single field at index time, and then use this field at
search time. This can be automated with the <a class="xref" href="copy-to.html" title="copy_to"><code class="literal">copy-to</code></a> directive of
mappings without having to change the source of documents. Here is an example
of an index containing movies that optimizes queries that search over both the
name and the plot of the movie by indexing both values into the <code class="literal">name_and_plot</code>
field.</p>
<a id="12facf3617a41551ce2f0c4d005cb1c7"></a>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">

<h3><a id="_pre_index_data"></a>Pre-index data<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.0/docs/reference/how-to/search-speed.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You should leverage patterns in your queries to optimize the way data is indexed.
For instance, if all your documents have a <code class="literal">price</code> field and most queries run
<a class="xref" href="search-aggregations-bucket-range-aggregation.html" title="Range aggregation"><code class="literal">range</code></a> aggregations on a fixed
list of ranges, you could make this aggregation faster by pre-indexing the ranges
into the index and using a <a class="xref" href="search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html" title="Terms aggregation"><code class="literal">terms</code></a>
aggregations.</p>
<p>For instance, if documents look like:</p>
<a id="a008f42379930edc354b4074e0a33344"></a>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT index/_doc/1
{
  "designation": "spoon",
  "price": 13
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1694.console"></div>
<p>and search requests look like:</p>
<a id="a0a7557bb7e2aff7918557cd648f41af"></a>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET index/_search
{
  "aggs": {
    "price_ranges": {
      "range": {
        "field": "price",
        "ranges": [
          { "to": 10 },
          { "from": 10, "to": 100 },
          { "from": 100 }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1695.console"></div>
<p>Then documents could be enriched by a <code class="literal">price_range</code> field at index time, which
should be mapped as a <a class="xref" href="keyword.html" title="Keyword type family"><code class="literal">keyword</code></a>:</p>
<a id="a4bae4d956bc0a663f42cfec36bf8e0b"></a>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>

  "price_range": "10-100"
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1696.console"></div>
<p>And then search requests could aggregate this new field rather than running a
<code class="literal">range</code> aggregation on the <code class="literal">price</code> field.</p>

<h3><a id="map-ids-as-keyword"></a>Consider mapping identifiers as <code class="literal">keyword</code><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.0/docs/reference/how-to/search-speed.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Not all numeric data should be mapped as a <a class="xref" href="number.html" title="Numeric field types">numeric</a> field data type.
Elasticsearch optimizes numeric fields, such as <code class="literal">integer</code> or <code class="literal">long</code>, for
<a class="xref" href="query-dsl-range-query.html" title="Range query"><code class="literal">range</code></a> queries. However, <a class="xref" href="keyword.html" title="Keyword type family"><code class="literal">keyword</code></a> fields
are better for <a class="xref" href="query-dsl-term-query.html" title="Term query"><code class="literal">term</code></a> and other
<a class="xref" href="term-level-queries.html" title="Term-level queries">term-level</a> queries.</p>
<p>Identifiers, such as an ISBN or a product ID, are rarely used in <code class="literal">range</code>
queries. However, they are often retrieved using term-level queries.</p>
<p>Consider mapping a numeric identifier as a <code class="literal">keyword</code> if:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You don&#8217;t plan to search for the identifier data using
<a class="xref" href="query-dsl-range-query.html" title="Range query"><code class="literal">range</code></a> queries.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Fast retrieval is important. <code class="literal">term</code> query searches on <code class="literal">keyword</code> fields are
often faster than <code class="literal">term</code> searches on numeric fields.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If you&#8217;re unsure which to use, you can use a <a class="xref" href="multi-fields.html" title="fields">multi-field</a> to map
the data as both a <code class="literal">keyword</code> <em>and</em> a numeric data type.</p>

<p>If possible, avoid using <a class="xref" href="modules-scripting.html" title="Scripting">script</a>-based sorting, scripts in
aggregations, and the <a class="xref" href="query-dsl-script-score-query.html" title="Script score query"><code class="literal">script_score</code></a> query. See
<a class="xref" href="scripts-and-search-speed.html" title="Scripts, caching, and search speed">Scripts, caching, and search speed</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_search_rounded_dates"></a>Search rounded dates<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.0/docs/reference/how-to/search-speed.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Queries on date fields that use <code class="literal">now</code> are typically not cacheable since the
range that is being matched changes all the time. However switching to a
rounded date is often acceptable in terms of user experience, and has the
benefit of making better use of the query cache.</p>
<p>For instance the below query:</p>
<a id="102c7de25d13c87cf28839ada9f63c95"></a>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT index/_doc/1
{
  "my_date": "2016-05-11T16:30:55.328Z"
}

GET index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "constant_score": {
      "filter": {
        "range": {
          "my_date": {
            "gte": "now-1h",
            "lte": "now"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1698.console"></div>
<p>could be replaced with the following query:</p>
<a id="17dd67a66c49f7eb618dd17430e48dfa"></a>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "constant_score": {
      "filter": {
        "range": {
          "my_date": {
            "gte": "now-1h/m",
            "lte": "now/m"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1699.console"></div>
<p>In that case we rounded to the minute, so if the current time is <code class="literal">16:31:29</code>,
the range query will match everything whose value of the <code class="literal">my_date</code> field is
between <code class="literal">15:31:00</code> and <code class="literal">16:31:59</code>. And if several users run a query that
contains this range in the same minute, the query cache could help speed things
up a bit. The longer the interval that is used for rounding, the more the query
cache can help, but beware that too aggressive rounding might also hurt user
experience.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>It might be tempting to split ranges into a large cacheable part and
smaller not cacheable parts in order to be able to leverage the query cache,
as shown below:</p>

<p>Indices that are read-only may benefit from being <a class="xref" href="indices-forcemerge.html" title="Force merge API">merged
down to a single segment</a>. This is typically the case with time-based indices:
only the index for the current time frame is getting new documents while older
indices are read-only. Shards that have been force-merged into a single segment
can use simpler and more efficient data structures to perform searches.</p>
<div class="important admon">

<div class="admon_content">
<p>Do not force-merge indices to which you are still writing, or to
which you will write again in the future. Instead, rely on the automatic

<p>If the machine running Elasticsearch is restarted, the filesystem cache will be

<h3><a id="preference-cache-optimization"></a>Use <code class="literal">preference</code> to optimize cache utilization<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.0/docs/reference/how-to/search-speed.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>There are multiple caches that can help with search performance, such as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_cache" class="ulink" target="_top">filesystem cache</a>, the
<a class="xref" href="shard-request-cache.html" title="Shard request cache settings">request cache</a> or the <a class="xref" href="query-cache.html" title="Node query cache settings">query cache</a>. Yet
all these caches are maintained at the node level, meaning that if you run the
same request twice in a row, have 1 replica or more
and use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS" class="ulink" target="_top">round-robin</a>, the default
routing algorithm, then those two requests will go to different shard copies,
preventing node-level caches from helping.</p>
<p>Since it is common for users of a search application to run similar requests
one after another, for instance in order to analyze a narrower subset of the
index, using a preference value that identifies the current user or session
could help optimize usage of the caches.</p>
<h3><a id="_replicas_might_help_with_throughput_but_not_always"></a>Replicas might help with throughput, but not always<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.0/docs/reference/how-to/search-speed.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In addition to improving resiliency, replicas can help improve throughput. For
instance if you have a single-shard index and three nodes, you will need to
set the number of replicas to 2 in order to have 3 copies of your shard in
total so that all nodes are utilized.</p>
<p>Now imagine that you have a 2-shards index and two nodes. In one case, the
number of replicas is 0, meaning that each node holds a single shard. In the
second case the number of replicas is 1, meaning that each node has two shards.
Which setup is going to perform best in terms of search performance? Usually,
the setup that has fewer shards per node in total will perform better. The
reason for that is that it gives a greater share of the available filesystem
cache to each shard, and the filesystem cache is probably Elasticsearch&#8217;s
number 1 performance factor. At the same time, beware that a setup that does
not have replicas is subject to failure in case of a single node failure, so
there is a trade-off between throughput and availability.</p>
<p>So what is the right number of replicas? If you have a cluster that has
<code class="literal">num_nodes</code> nodes, <code class="literal">num_primaries</code> primary shards <em>in total</em> and if you want to
be able to cope with <code class="literal">max_failures</code> node failures at once at most, then the
right number of replicas for you is
<code class="literal">max(max_failures, ceil(num_nodes / num_primaries) - 1)</code>.</p>
