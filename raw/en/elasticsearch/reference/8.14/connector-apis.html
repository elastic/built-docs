<p>The connector and sync jobs APIs provide a convenient way to create and manage Elastic <a href="/guide/en/enterprise-search/8.14/connectors.html" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connectors</a> and sync jobs in an internal index. To get started with Connector APIs, check out the <a href="/guide/en/enterprise-search/8.14/connectors-tutorial-api.html" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>Connectors are Elasticsearch integrations that bring content from third-party data sources, which can be deployed on Elastic Cloud or hosted on your own infrastructure:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Native connectors</strong></span> are a managed service on Elastic Cloud
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Connector clients</strong></span> are self-managed on your infrastructure
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Find a list of all supported service types in the <a href="/guide/en/enterprise-search/8.14/connectors.html" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connectors documentation</a>.</p>
<p>This API provides an alternative to relying solely on Kibana UI for connector and sync job management. The API comes with a set of
validations and assertions to ensure that the state representation in the internal index remains valid.</p>

<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>We also have a command-line interface for Elastic connectors. Learn more in the <a href="https://github.com/elastic/connectors/blob/main/docs/CLI.md" class="ulink" target="_top">elastic/connectors</a> repository.</p>
