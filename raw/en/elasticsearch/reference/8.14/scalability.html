<p>Elasticsearch is built to be always available and to scale with your needs. It does this
by being distributed by nature. You can add servers (nodes) to a cluster to
increase capacity and Elasticsearch automatically distributes your data and query load
across all of the available nodes. No need to overhaul your application, Elasticsearch
knows how to balance multi-node clusters to provide scale and high availability.
The more nodes, the merrier.</p>
<p>How does this work? Under the covers, an Elasticsearch index is really just a logical
grouping of one or more physical shards, where each shard is actually a
self-contained index. By distributing the documents in an index across multiple
shards, and distributing those shards across multiple nodes, Elasticsearch can ensure
redundancy, which both protects against hardware failures and increases
query capacity as nodes are added to a cluster. As the cluster grows (or shrinks),
Elasticsearch automatically migrates shards to rebalance the cluster.</p>
<p>There are two types of shards: primaries and replicas. Each document in an index
belongs to one primary shard. A replica shard is a copy of a primary shard.
Replicas provide redundant copies of your data to protect against hardware
failure and increase capacity to serve read requests
like searching or retrieving a document.</p>
<p>The number of primary shards in an index is fixed at the time that an index is
created, but the number of replica shards can be changed at any time, without
interrupting indexing or query operations.</p>
<h4><a id="it-depends"></a>It depends&#8230;&#8203;<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.14/docs/reference/intro.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>There are a number of performance considerations and trade offs with respect
to shard size and the number of primary shards configured for an index. The more
shards, the more overhead there is simply in maintaining those indices. The
larger the shard size, the longer it takes to move shards around when Elasticsearch
needs to rebalance a cluster.</p>
<p>Querying lots of small shards makes the processing per shard faster, but more
queries means more overhead, so querying a smaller
number of larger shards might be faster. In short&#8230;&#8203;it depends.</p>
<p>As a starting point:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Aim to keep the average shard size between a few GB and a few tens of GB. For
use cases with time-based data, it is common to see shards in the 20GB to 40GB
range.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Avoid the gazillion shards problem. The number of shards a node can hold is
proportional to the available heap space. As a general rule, the number of
shards per GB of heap space should be less than 20.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The best way to determine the optimal configuration for your use case is
through <a href="/elasticon/conf/2016/sf/quantitative-cluster-sizing" class="ulink" target="_top">
testing with your own data and queries</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="disaster-ccr"></a>In case of disaster<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.14/docs/reference/intro.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>A cluster&#8217;s nodes need good, reliable connections to each other. To provide
better connections, you typically co-locate the nodes in the same data center or
nearby data centers. However, to maintain high availability, you
also need to avoid any single point of failure. In the event of a major outage
in one location, servers in another location need to be able to take over. The
answer? Cross-cluster replication (CCR).</p>
<p>CCR provides a way to automatically synchronize indices from your primary cluster
to a secondary remote cluster that can serve as a hot backup. If the primary
cluster fails, the secondary cluster can take over. You can also use CCR to
create secondary clusters to serve read requests in geo-proximity to your users.</p>
<p>Cross-cluster replication is active-passive. The index on the primary cluster is
the active leader index and handles all write requests. Indices replicated to
secondary clusters are read-only followers.</p>

<p>As with any enterprise system, you need tools to secure, manage, and
monitor your Elasticsearch clusters. Security, monitoring, and administrative features
that are integrated into Elasticsearch enable you to use <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.14/introduction.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana</a>
as a control center for managing a cluster. Features like <a class="xref" href="downsampling.html" title="Downsampling a time series data stream">downsampling</a> and <a class="xref" href="index-lifecycle-management.html" title="ILM: Manage the index lifecycle">index lifecycle management</a>
help you intelligently manage your data over time.</p>
