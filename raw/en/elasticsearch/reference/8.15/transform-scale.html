<p>Transforms convert existing Elasticsearch indices into summarized indices, which
provide opportunities for new insights and analytics. The search and index
operations performed by transforms use standard Elasticsearch features so similar
considerations for working with Elasticsearch at scale are often applicable to
transforms. If you experience performance issues, start by identifying the
bottleneck areas (search, indexing, processing, or storage) then review the
relevant considerations in this guide to improve performance. It also helps to
understand how transforms work as different considerations apply depending on
whether or not your transform is running in continuous mode or in batch.</p>
<p>In this guide, you&#8217;ll learn how to:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Understand the impact of configuration options on the performance of
transforms.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></span></p>
<p>These guildelines assume you have a transform you want to tune, and you’re
already familiar with:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="transform-overview.html" title="Transform overview">How transforms work</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="transform-setup.html" title="Set up transforms">How to set up transforms</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="transform-checkpoints.html" title="How transform checkpoints work">How transform checkpoints work in continuous mode</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The following considerations are not sequential – the numbers help to navigate
between the list items; you can take action on one or more of them in any order.
Most of the recommendations apply to both continuous and batch transforms. If
a list item only applies to one transform type, this exception is highlighted
in the description.</p>
<p>The keywords in parenthesis at the end of each recommendation title indicates
the bottleneck area that may be improved by following the given recommendation.</p>
<h4><a id="measure-performance"></a>Measure transforms performance<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.15/docs/reference/transform/transforms-at-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>In order to optimize transform performance, start by identifying the areas
where most work is being done. The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stats</strong></span> interface of the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Transforms</strong></span> page in Kibana contains information that covers three main
areas: indexing, searching, and processing time (alternatively, you can use the
<a class="xref" href="get-transform-stats.html" title="Get transform statistics API">transforms stats API</a>). If, for example, the results
show that the highest proportion of time is spent on search, then prioritize
efforts on optimizing the search query of the transform. Transforms also
has <a href="https://esrally.readthedocs.io" class="ulink" target="_top">Rally support</a> that makes it possible to run
performance checks on transforms configurations if it is required. If you
optimized the crucial factors and you still experience performance issues, you
may also want to consider improving your hardware.</p>
<h4><a id="frequency"></a>1. Optimize <code class="literal">frequency</code> (index)<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.15/docs/reference/transform/transforms-at-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>In a continuous transform, the <code class="literal">frequency</code> configuration option sets the interval
between checks for changes in the source indices. If changes are detected, then
the source data is searched and the changes are applied to the destination
index. Depending on your use case, you may wish to reduce the frequency at which
changes are applied. By setting <code class="literal">frequency</code> to a higher value (maximum is one
hour), the workload can be spread over time at the cost of less up-to-date data.</p>
<h4><a id="increase-shards-dest-index"></a>2. Increase the number of shards of the destination index (index)<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.15/docs/reference/transform/transforms-at-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Depending on the size of the destination index, you may consider increasing its
shard count. Transforms use one shard by default when creating the
destination index. To override the index settings, create the destination index
before starting the transform. For more information about how the number of
shards affects scalability and resilience, refer to <a class="xref" href="scalability.html" title="Scalability and resilience: clusters, nodes, and shards">Scalability and resilience</a></p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Use the <a class="xref" href="preview-transform.html" title="Preview transform API">Preview transform</a> to check the settings that the transform
would use to create the destination index. You can copy and adjust these in
order to create the destination index prior to starting the transform.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4><a id="search-queries"></a>3. Profile and optimize your search queries (search)<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.15/docs/reference/transform/transforms-at-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>If you have defined a transform source index <code class="literal">query</code>, ensure it is as
efficient as possible. Use the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Search Profiler</strong></span> under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Dev Tools</strong></span> in Kibana
to get detailed timing information about the execution of individual components
in the search request. Alternatively, you can use the <a class="xref" href="search-profile.html" title="Profile API">Profile</a>. The
results give you insight into how search requests are executed at a low level so
that you can understand why certain requests are slow, and take steps to improve
them.</p>
<p>Transforms execute standard Elasticsearch search requests. There are different ways
to write Elasticsearch queries, and some of them are more efficient than others. Consult
<a class="xref" href="tune-for-search-speed.html" title="Tune for search speed"><em>Tune for search speed</em></a> to learn more about Elasticsearch performance tuning.</p>
<h4><a id="limit-source-query"></a>4. Limit the scope of the source query (search)<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.15/docs/reference/transform/transforms-at-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Imagine your continuous transform is configured to group by <code class="literal">IP</code> and calculate the sum
of <code class="literal">bytes_sent</code>. For each checkpoint, a continuous transform detects changes in the
source data since the previous checkpoint, identifying the IPs for which new
data has been ingested. Then it performs a second search, filtered for this
group of IPs, in order to calculate the total <code class="literal">bytes_sent</code>. If this second
search matches many shards, then this could be resource intensive. Consider
limiting the scope that the source index pattern and query will match.</p>
<p>To limit which historical indices are accessed, exclude certain tiers (for
example <code class="literal">"must_not": { "terms": { "_tier": [ "data_frozen", "data_cold" ] } }</code>
and/or use an absolute time value as a date range filter in your source query
(for example, greater than 2024-01-01T00:00:00). If you use a relative time
value (for example, gte now-30d/d) then ensure date rounding is applied to take
advantage of query caching and ensure that the relative time is much larger than
the largest of <code class="literal">frequency</code> or <code class="literal">time.sync.delay</code> or the date histogram bucket,
otherwise data may be missed. Do not use date filters which are less than a date
value (for example, <code class="literal">lt</code>: less than  or <code class="literal">lte</code>: less than or equal to) as this
conflicts with the logic applied at each checkpoint execution and data may be
missed.</p>
<p>Consider using <a class="xref" href="api-conventions.html#api-date-math-index-names" title="Date math support in index and index alias names">date math</a> in your index names to
reduce the number of indices to resolve in your queries. Add a date pattern
- for example, <code class="literal">yyyy-MM-dd</code> - to your index names and use it to limit your query
to a specific date. The example below queries indices only from yesterday and
today:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">  "source": {
    "index": [
        "&lt;mydata-{now/d-1d{yyyy-MM-dd}}*&gt;",
        "&lt;mydata-{now/d{yyyy-MM-dd}}*&gt;"
    ]
  },</pre>
</div>
<h4><a id="optimize-shading-strategy"></a>5. Optimize the sharding strategy for the source index (search)<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.15/docs/reference/transform/transforms-at-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all sharding strategy. A strategy that works in one
environment may not scale in another. A good sharding strategy must account for
your infrastructure, use case, and performance expectations.</p>
<p>Too few shards may mean that the benefits of distributing the workload cannot be
realised; however too many shards may impact your cluster health. To learn more
about sizing your shards, read this <a class="xref" href="size-your-shards.html" title="Size your shards">guide</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="tune-max-page-search-size"></a>6. Tune <code class="literal">max_page_search_size</code> (search)<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.15/docs/reference/transform/transforms-at-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The <code class="literal">max_page_search_size</code> transform configuration option defines the number
of buckets that are returned for each search request. The default value is 500.
If you increase this value, you get better throughput at the cost of higher
latency and memory usage.</p>
<p>The ideal value of this parameter is highly dependent on your use case. If your
transform executes memory-intensive aggregations – for example, cardinality or
percentiles – then increasing <code class="literal">max_page_search_size</code> requires more available
memory. If memory limits are exceeded, a circuit breaker exception occurs.</p>
<h4><a id="indexed-fields-in-source"></a>7. Use indexed fields in your source indices (search)<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.15/docs/reference/transform/transforms-at-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Runtime fields and scripted fields are not indexed fields; their values are only
extracted or computed at search time. While these fields provide flexibility in
how you access your data, they increase performance costs at search time. If
transform performance using runtime fields or scripted fields is a concern,
you may wish to consider using indexed fields instead. For performance reasons,
we do not recommend using a runtime field as the time field that synchronizes a
continuous transform.</p>
<h4><a id="index-sorting-group-by-ordering"></a>8. Use index sorting (search, process)<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.15/docs/reference/transform/transforms-at-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Index sorting enables you to store documents on disk in a specific order which
can improve query efficiency. The ideal sorting logic depends on your use case,
but the rule of thumb may be to sort the fields in descending order (high to low
cardinality) starting with the time-based fields. Index sorting
can be defined only once at index creation. If you don&#8217;t already have index
sorting on the index that you want to use as a source, consider reindexing it to
a new, sorted index.</p>
<h4><a id="disable-source-dest"></a>9. Disable the <code class="literal">_source</code> field on the destination index (storage)<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.15/docs/reference/transform/transforms-at-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The <a class="xref" href="mapping-source-field.html" title="_source field"><code class="literal">_source</code> field</a> contains the original JSON document body that was
passed at index time. The <code class="literal">_source</code> field itself is not indexed (and thus is not
searchable), but it is still stored in the index and incurs a storage overhead.
Consider disabling <code class="literal">_source</code> to save storage space if you have a large
destination index. Disabling <code class="literal">_source</code> is only possible during index creation.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>When the <code class="literal">_source</code> field is disabled, a number of features are not
supported. Consult <a class="xref" href="mapping-source-field.html#disable-source-field" title="Disabling the _source field">Disabling the <code class="literal">_source</code> field</a> to understand the consequences
before disabling it.</p>
