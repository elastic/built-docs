<p>Schedule <a class="xref" href="trigger.html" title="Watcher triggers">triggers</a> define when the watch execution should start based
on date and time. All times are in UTC time unless a timezone is explicitly specified
in the schedule.</p>
<p>Watcher uses the system clock to determine the current time. To ensure schedules
are triggered when expected, you should synchronize the clocks of all nodes in the
cluster using a time service such as <a href="http://www.ntp.org/" class="ulink" target="_top">NTP</a>.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Watcher can&#8217;t correct for manual adjustments to the system clock. Be aware when making
such changes that watch execution may be affected with watches being skipped or repeated if the
adjustment covers their target execution time. This applies to changes made via NTP as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When specifying a timezone for a watch, keep in mind the effect daylight savings time
transitions may have on the schedule, especially if the watch is scheduled to run
during the transition. Here&#8217;s how Watcher handles watches scheduled during discontinuities:</p>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div>
<div class="position-relative"><h3 class="title"><a id="_gap_transitions"></a>Gap Transitions</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.19/docs/reference/watcher/trigger/schedule.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
</div></div></div>
<p>These occur when the clock moves forward, such as when daylight savings time starts
and cause certain hours or minutes to be skipped. If your watch is scheduled to run
during a gap transition, the watch is executed at the same time as before the transition.</p>
<p>Example: If a watch is scheduled to run daily at 1:30AM in the <code class="literal">Europe/London</code> time zone and
the clock moves forward one hour from 1:00AM (GMT+0) to 2:00AM (GMT+1), the watch is executed
at 2:30AM (GMT+1) which would have been 1:30AM before the transition. Subsequent executions
happen at 1:30AM (GMT+1).</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div>
<div class="position-relative"><h3 class="title"><a id="_overlap_transitions"></a>Overlap Transitions</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.19/docs/reference/watcher/trigger/schedule.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
</div></div></div>
<p>These occur when the clock moves backward, such as when daylight savings time ends
and cause certain hours or minutes to be repeated. If your watch is scheduled to run
during an overlap transition, only the first occurrence of the time causes to the watch
to execute with the second being skipped.</p>
<p>Example: If a watch is scheduled to run at 1:30 AM and the clock moves backward one hour
from 2:00AM to 1:00AM, the watch is executed at 1:30AM and the second occurrence after the
change is skipped.</p>
