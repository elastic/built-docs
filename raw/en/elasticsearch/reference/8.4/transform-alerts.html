<p>Kibana alerting features include support for transform rules, which check the
health of continuous transforms with certain conditions. If the conditions of the rule
are met, an alert is created and the associated action is triggered. For
example, you can create a rule to check if a continuous transform is started and to
notify you in an email if it is not. To learn more about Kibana alerting features,
refer to
<a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.4/alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-getting-started" class="ulink" target="_top">Alerting</a>.</p>
<p>The following transform rules are available:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Transform health
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Monitors transforms health and alerts if an operational issue occurred.
</dd>
</dl>

</div></div></div>
<p>You can create transform rules under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management &gt; Rules</strong></span>.</p>
<p>On the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Create rule</strong></span> window, give a name to the rule and optionally provide
tags. Specify the time interval for the rule to check transform health
changes. You can also select a notification option with the <em>Notify</em> selector.
An alert remains active as long as the configured conditions are met during the
check interval. When there is no matching condition in the next interval, the
<code class="literal">Recovered</code> action group is invoked and the status of the alert changes to <code class="literal">OK</code>.
For more details, refer to the documentation of
<a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.4/create-and-manage-rules.html#defining-rules-general-details" class="ulink" target="_top">general rule details</a>.</p>
<p>Select the Transform health rule type under the Stack Monitoring section.</p>

<p>Select the transform or transforms to include. You can also use a special
character (<code class="literal">*</code>) to apply the rule to all your transforms. Transforms
created after the rule are automatically included.</p>
<p>The following health check is available and enabled by default:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>Transform is not started</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Notifies if the corresponding transforms is not started or it does not index
any data. The notification message recommends the necessary actions to solve
the error.
</dd>

<p>As the last step in the rule creation process,
<a class="xref" href="transform-alerts.html#defining-actions" title="Defining actions">define the actions</a> that occur when the conditions
are met.</p>

<p>Connect your rule to actions that use supported built-in integrations by
selecting a connector type. Connectors are Kibana services or third-party
integrations that perform an action when the rule conditions are met or the
alert is recovered. You can select in which case the action will run.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">

</div>
</div>
<p>For example, you can choose <em>Slack</em> as a connector type and configure it to send
a message to a channel you selected. You can also create an index connector that
writes the JSON object you configure to a specific index. It&#8217;s also possible to
customize the notification messages. A list of variables is available to include
in the message, like transform ID, description, transform state, and so on.</p>
<p>After you save the configurations, the rule appears in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Rules</strong></span> list
where you can check its status and see the overview of its configuration
information.</p>
<p>The name of an alert is always the same as the transform ID of the associated
transform that triggered it. You can mute the notifications for a particular
transform on the page of the rule that lists the individual alerts. You can
open it via <span class="strong strong"><strong>Rules</strong></span> by selecting the rule name.</p>
