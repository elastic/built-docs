<p>Any time that you start an instance of Elasticsearch, you are starting a <em>node</em>. A
collection of connected nodes is called a <a class="xref" href="modules-cluster.html" title="Cluster-level shard allocation and routing settings">cluster</a>. If you
are running a single node of Elasticsearch, then you have a cluster of one node.</p>
<p>Every node in the cluster can handle <a class="xref" href="modules-network.html" title="Networking">HTTP and transport</a>
traffic by default. The transport layer is used exclusively for communication
between nodes; the HTTP layer is used by REST clients.</p>
<p><a id="modules-node-description"></a>All nodes know about all the other nodes in the cluster and can forward client
requests to the appropriate node.</p>

<h3>Coordinating node<a id="coordinating-node"></a></h3>
<p>Requests like search requests or bulk-indexing requests may involve data held
on different data nodes. A search request, for example, is executed in two
phases which are coordinated by the node which receives the client request&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the <em>coordinating node</em>.</p>
<p>In the <em>scatter</em> phase, the coordinating node forwards the request to the data
nodes which hold the data. Each data node executes the request locally and
returns its results to the coordinating node. In the <em>gather</em> phase, the
coordinating node reduces each data node&#8217;s results into a single global
result set.</p>
<p>Every node is implicitly a coordinating node. This means that a node that has
an explicit empty list of roles via <code class="literal">node.roles</code> will only act as a coordinating
node, which cannot be disabled. As a result, such a node needs to have enough
memory and CPU in order to deal with the gather phase.</p>

<p>The master node is responsible for lightweight cluster-wide actions such as
creating or deleting an index, tracking which nodes are part of the cluster,
and deciding which shards to allocate to which nodes. It is important for

<p>Any master-eligible node that is not a <a class="xref" href="modules-node.html#voting-only-node" title="Voting-only master-eligible node">voting-only node</a> may

<p>It is important for the health of the cluster that the elected master node has
the resources it needs to fulfill its responsibilities. If the elected master
node is overloaded with other tasks then the cluster will not operate well. The
most reliable way to avoid overloading the master with other tasks is to
configure all the master-eligible nodes to be <em>dedicated master-eligible nodes</em>
which only have the <code class="literal">master</code> role, allowing them to focus on managing the
cluster. Master-eligible nodes will still also behave as
<a class="xref" href="modules-node.html#coordinating-node" title="Coordinating node">coordinating nodes</a> that route requests from clients to
the other nodes in the cluster, but you should <em>not</em> use dedicated master nodes
for this purpose.</p>
<p>A small or lightly-loaded cluster may operate well if its master-eligible nodes
have other roles and responsibilities, but once your cluster comprises more
than a handful of nodes it usually makes sense to use dedicated master-eligible
nodes.</p>
<p>To create a dedicated master-eligible node, set:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">node.roles: [ master ]</pre>
</div>

</div></div></div>
<p>A voting-only master-eligible node is a node that participates in
<a class="xref" href="modules-discovery.html" title="Discovery and cluster formation">master elections</a> but which will not act as the cluster&#8217;s
elected master node. In particular, a voting-only node can serve as a tiebreaker
in elections.</p>
<p>It may seem confusing to use the term "master-eligible" to describe a
voting-only node since such a node is not actually eligible to become the master
at all. This terminology is an unfortunate consequence of history:
master-eligible nodes are those nodes that participate in elections and perform
certain tasks during cluster state publications, and voting-only nodes have the
same responsibilities even if they can never become the elected master.</p>
<p>To configure a master-eligible node as a voting-only node, include <code class="literal">master</code> and
<code class="literal">voting_only</code> in the list of roles. For example to create a voting-only data
node:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">node.roles: [ data, master, voting_only ]</pre>
</div>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Only nodes with the <code class="literal">master</code> role can be marked as having the
<code class="literal">voting_only</code> role.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>High availability (HA) clusters require at least three master-eligible nodes, at
least two of which are not voting-only nodes. Such a cluster will be able to
elect a master node even if one of the nodes fails.</p>
<p>Voting-only master-eligible nodes may also fill other roles in your cluster.
For instance, a node may be both a data node and a voting-only master-eligible
node. A <em>dedicated</em> voting-only master-eligible nodes is a voting-only
master-eligible node that fills no other roles in the cluster. To create a
dedicated voting-only master-eligible node, set:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">node.roles: [ master, voting_only ]</pre>
</div>
<p>Since dedicated voting-only nodes never act as the cluster&#8217;s elected master,
they may require less heap and a less powerful CPU than the true master nodes.
However all master-eligible nodes, including voting-only nodes, are on the
critical path for <a class="xref" href="cluster-state-publishing.html" title="Publishing the cluster state">publishing cluster state
updates</a>. Cluster state updates are usually independent of
performance-critical workloads such as indexing or searches, but they are
involved in management activities such as index creation and rollover, mapping
updates, and recovery after a failure. The performance characteristics of these
activities are a function of the speed of the storage on each master-eligible
node, as well as the reliability and latency of the network interconnections
between the elected master node and the other nodes in the cluster. You must
therefore ensure that the storage and networking available to the nodes in your
cluster are good enough to meet your performance goals.</p>

<p>Data nodes hold the shards that contain the documents you have indexed. Data
nodes handle data related operations like CRUD, search, and aggregations.
These operations are I/O-, memory-, and CPU-intensive. It is important to
monitor these resources and to add more data nodes if they are overloaded.</p>
<p>The main benefit of having dedicated data nodes is the separation of the master
and data roles.</p>
<p>To create a dedicated data node, set:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">node.roles: [ data ]</pre>
</div>
<p>In a multi-tier deployment architecture, you use specialized data roles to
assign data nodes to specific tiers: <code class="literal">data_content</code>,<code class="literal">data_hot</code>, <code class="literal">data_warm</code>,
<code class="literal">data_cold</code>, or <code class="literal">data_frozen</code>. A node can belong to multiple tiers, but a node
that has one of the specialized data roles cannot have the generic <code class="literal">data</code> role.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>Content data nodes are part of the content tier.
Data stored in the content tier is generally a collection of items such as a product catalog or article archive.
Unlike time series data, the value of the content remains relatively constant over time,
so it doesn&#8217;t make sense to move it to a tier with different performance characteristics as it ages.
Content data typically has long data retention requirements, and you want to be able to retrieve
items quickly regardless of how old they are.</p>
<p>Content tier nodes are usually optimized for query performance&#8212;&#8203;they prioritize processing power over IO throughput
so they can process complex searches and aggregations and return results quickly.
While they are also responsible for indexing, content data is generally not ingested at as high a rate
as time series data such as logs and metrics. From a resiliency perspective the indices in this
tier should be configured to use one or more replicas.</p>
<p>The content tier is required. System indices and other indices that aren&#8217;t part
of a data stream are automatically allocated to the content tier.</p>
<p>To create a dedicated content node, set:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">

</div></div></div>
<p>Hot data nodes are part of the hot tier.
The hot tier is the Elasticsearch entry point for time series data and holds your most-recent,
most-frequently-searched time series data.
Nodes in the hot tier need to be fast for both reads and writes,
which requires more hardware resources and faster storage (SSDs).
For resiliency, indices in the hot tier should be configured to use one or more replicas.</p>
<p>The hot tier is required. New indices that are part of a <a class="xref" href="data-streams.html" title="Data streams">data stream</a> are automatically allocated to the hot tier.</p>
<p>To create a dedicated hot node, set:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">

</div></div></div>
<p>Warm data nodes are part of the warm tier.
Time series data can move to the warm tier once it is being queried less frequently
than the recently-indexed data in the hot tier.
The warm tier typically holds data from recent weeks.
Updates are still allowed, but likely infrequent.
Nodes in the warm tier generally don&#8217;t need to be as fast as those in the hot tier.
For resiliency, indices in the warm tier should be configured to use one or more replicas.</p>
<p>To create a dedicated warm node, set:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">node.roles: [ data_warm ]</pre>

</div></div></div>
<p>Cold data nodes are part of the cold tier.
When you no longer need to search time series data regularly, it can move from
the warm tier to the cold tier. While still searchable, this tier is typically
optimized for lower storage costs rather than search speed.</p>
<p>For better storage savings, you can keep <a class="xref" href="searchable-snapshots.html#fully-mounted">fully mounted indices</a>
of <a class="xref" href="ilm-searchable-snapshot.html" title="Searchable snapshot">searchable snapshots</a> on the cold tier. Unlike regular
indices, these fully mounted indices don&#8217;t require replicas for reliability. In
the event of a failure, they can recover data from the underlying snapshot
instead. This potentially halves the local storage needed for the data. A
snapshot repository is required to use fully mounted indices in the cold tier.
Fully mounted indices are read-only.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the cold tier to store regular indices with replicas instead
of using searchable snapshots. This lets you store older data on less expensive hardware
but doesn&#8217;t reduce required disk space compared to the warm tier.</p>
<p>To create a dedicated cold node, set:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">

</div></div></div>
<p>Frozen data nodes are part of the frozen tier.
Once data is no longer being queried, or being queried rarely, it may move from
the cold tier to the frozen tier where it stays for the rest of its life.</p>
<p>The frozen tier requires a snapshot repository.
The frozen tier uses <a class="xref" href="searchable-snapshots.html#partially-mounted">partially mounted indices</a> to store
and load data from a snapshot repository. This reduces local storage and
operating costs while still letting you search frozen data. Because Elasticsearch must
sometimes fetch frozen data from the snapshot repository, searches on the frozen
tier are typically slower than on the cold tier.</p>

<p>Ingest nodes can execute pre-processing pipelines, composed of one or more

<p>If you take away the ability to be able to handle master duties, to hold data,
and pre-process documents, then you are left with a <em>coordinating</em> node that
can only route requests, handle the search reduce phase, and distribute bulk
indexing. Essentially, coordinating only nodes behave as smart load balancers.</p>
<p>Coordinating only nodes can benefit large clusters by offloading the
coordinating node role from data and master-eligible nodes. They join the
cluster and receive the full <a class="xref" href="cluster-state.html" title="Cluster state API">cluster state</a>, like every other
node, and they use the cluster state to route requests directly to the
appropriate place(s).</p>

<p>Each data node maintains the following data on disk:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
the shard data for every shard allocated to that node,
</li>
<li class="listitem">
the index metadata corresponding with every shard allocated to that node, and
</li>
<li class="listitem">
the cluster-wide metadata, such as settings and index templates.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Similarly, each master-eligible node maintains the following data on disk:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
the index metadata for every index in the cluster, and
</li>
<li class="listitem">
the cluster-wide metadata, such as settings and index templates.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Each node checks the contents of its data path at startup. If it discovers
unexpected data then it will refuse to start. This is to avoid importing
unwanted <a class="xref" href="modules-gateway-dangling-indices.html" title="Dangling indices">dangling indices</a> which can lead
to a red cluster health. To be more precise, nodes without the <code class="literal">data</code> role will
refuse to start if they find any shard data on disk at startup, and nodes
without both the <code class="literal">master</code> and <code class="literal">data</code> roles will refuse to start if they have any
index metadata on disk at startup.</p>
<p>It is possible to change the roles of a node by adjusting its
<code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code> file and restarting it. This is known as <em>repurposing</em> a
node. In order to satisfy the checks for unexpected data described above, you
must perform some extra steps to prepare a node for repurposing when starting
the node without the <code class="literal">data</code> or <code class="literal">master</code> roles.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
If you want to repurpose a data node by removing the <code class="literal">data</code> role then you
should first use an <a class="xref" href="allocation-filtering.html" title="Cluster-level shard allocation filtering">allocation filter</a> to safely
migrate all the shard data onto other nodes in the cluster.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you want to repurpose a node to have neither the <code class="literal">data</code> nor <code class="literal">master</code> roles
then it is simplest to start a brand-new node with an empty data path and the
desired roles. You may find it safest to use an
<a class="xref" href="allocation-filtering.html" title="Cluster-level shard allocation filtering">allocation filter</a> to migrate the shard data elsewhere
in the cluster first.

<h3 class="title"><a id="data-path"></a><code class="literal">path.data</code><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.7/docs/reference/modules/node.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>

<p>Every data and master-eligible node requires access to a data directory where
shards and index and cluster metadata will be stored. The <code class="literal">path.data</code> defaults
to <code class="literal">$ES_HOME/data</code> but can be configured in the <code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code> config
file an absolute path or a path relative to <code class="literal">$ES_HOME</code> as follows:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">path.data:  /var/elasticsearch/data</pre>
</div>
<p>Like all node settings, it can also be specified on the command line as:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sh">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sh">./bin/elasticsearch -Epath.data=/var/elasticsearch/data</pre>
</div>
<p>The contents of the <code class="literal">path.data</code> directory must persist across restarts, because
this is where your data is stored. Elasticsearch requires the filesystem to act as if it
were backed by a local disk, but this means that it will work correctly on
properly-configured remote block devices (e.g. a SAN) and remote filesystems
(e.g. NFS) as long as the remote storage behaves no differently from local
storage. You can run multiple Elasticsearch nodes on the same filesystem, but each Elasticsearch
node must have its own data path.</p>
<p>The performance of an Elasticsearch cluster is often limited by the performance of the
underlying storage, so you must ensure that your storage supports acceptable
performance. Some remote storage performs very poorly, especially under the
kind of load that Elasticsearch imposes, so make sure to benchmark your system carefully
before committing to a particular storage architecture.</p>

<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>When using the <code class="literal">.zip</code> or <code class="literal">.tar.gz</code> distributions, the <code class="literal">path.data</code> setting
should be configured to locate the data directory outside the Elasticsearch home
directory, so that the home directory can be deleted without deleting your data!
The RPM and Debian distributions do this for you already.</p>

<div class="warning admon">

<div class="admon_content">
<p>Don&#8217;t modify anything within the data directory or run processes that
might interfere with its contents. If something other than Elasticsearch modifies the
contents of the data directory, then Elasticsearch may fail, reporting corruption or
other data inconsistencies, or may appear to work correctly having silently
lost some of your data. Don&#8217;t attempt to take filesystem backups of the data
directory; there is no supported way to restore such a backup. Instead, use
<a class="xref" href="snapshot-restore.html" title="Snapshot and restore">Snapshot and restore</a> to take backups safely. Don&#8217;t run virus scanners on the
data directory. A virus scanner can prevent Elasticsearch from working correctly and may
modify the contents of the data directory. The data directory contains no
executables so a virus scan will only find false positives.</p>
