<p>The <code class="literal">random_sampler</code> aggregation is a single bucket aggregation that randomly
includes documents in the aggregated results. Sampling provides significant
speed improvement at the cost of accuracy.</p>
<p>The sampling is accomplished by providing a random subset of the entire set of
documents in a shard. If a filter query is provided in the search request, that
filter is applied over the sampled subset. Consequently, if a filter is
restrictive, very few documents might match; therefore, the statistics might not
be as accurate.</p>

<p>The aggregation is a random sample of all the documents in the index. In other
words, the sampling is over the background set of documents. If a query is
provided, a document is returned if it is matched by the query and if the
document is in the random sampling. The sampling is not done over the matched
documents.</p>
<p>Consider the set of documents <code class="literal">[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>. Your query matches <code class="literal">[1, 3, 5]</code>
and the randomly sampled set is <code class="literal">[2, 4, 5]</code>. In this case, the document returned
would be <code class="literal">[5]</code>.</p>
<p>This type of sampling provides almost linear improvement in query latency in relation to the amount
by which sampling reduces the document set size:</p>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/aggregations/random-sampler-agg-graph.png" alt="Graph of the median speedup by sampling factor">
</div>
</div>
<p>This graph is typical of the speed up for the majority of aggregations for a test data set of 63 million documents. The exact constants will depend on the data set size and the number of shards, but the form of the relationship between speed up and probability holds widely. For certain aggregations, the speed up may not
be as dramatic. These aggregations have some constant overhead unrelated to the number of documents seen. Even for
those aggregations, the speed improvements can be significant.</p>
<p>The sample set is generated by skipping documents using a geometric distribution
(<code class="literal">(1-p)^(k-1)*p</code>) with success probability being the provided <code class="literal">probability</code> (<code class="literal">p</code> in the distribution equation).
The values returned from the distribution indicate how many documents to skip in
the background. This is equivalent to selecting documents uniformly at random. It follows that the expected number of failures before a success is
<code class="literal">(1-p)/p</code>. For example, with the <code class="literal">"probability": 0.01</code>, the expected number of failures (or
average number of documents skipped) would be <code class="literal">99</code> with a variance of <code class="literal">9900</code>.
Consequently, if you had only 80 documents in your index or matched by your
filter, you would most likely receive no results.</p>

<p>In the above image <code class="literal">p</code> is the probability provided to the aggregation, and <code class="literal">n</code> is the number of documents matched by whatever
query is provided. You can see the impact of outliers on <code class="literal">sum</code> and <code class="literal">mean</code>, but when many documents are still matched at
higher sampling rates, the relative error is still low.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>This represents the result of aggregations against a typical positively skewed APM data set which also has outliers in the upper tail. The linear dependence of the relative error on the sample size is found to hold widely, but the slope depends on the variation in the quantity being aggregated. As such, the variance in your own data may
      cause relative error rates to increase or decrease at a different rate.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>All counts returned by the random sampler aggregation are scaled to ease visualizations and calculations. For example,
when randomly sampling a <a class="xref" href="search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html" title="Date histogram aggregation">date histogram aggregation</a> every
<code class="literal">doc_count</code> value for every bucket is scaled by the inverse of the random_sampler <code class="literal">probability</code> value. So, if <code class="literal">doc_count</code>
for a bucket is <code class="literal">10,000</code> with <code class="literal">probability: 0.1</code>, the actual number of documents aggregated is <code class="literal">1,000</code>.</p>
<p>An exception to this is <a class="xref" href="search-aggregations-metrics-cardinality-aggregation.html" title="Cardinality aggregation">cardinality aggregation</a>. Unique item
counts are not suitable for automatic scaling. When interpreting the cardinality count, compare it
to the number of sampled docs provided in the top level <code class="literal">doc_count</code> within the random_sampler aggregation. It gives
you an idea of unique values as a percentage of total values. It may not reflect, however, the exact number of unique values
for the given field.</p>
