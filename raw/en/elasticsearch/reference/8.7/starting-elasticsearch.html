<p>The method for starting Elasticsearch varies depending on how you installed it.</p>
<h3><a id="start-targz"></a>Archive packages (<code class="literal">.tar.gz</code>)<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.7/docs/reference/setup/starting.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If you installed Elasticsearch with a <code class="literal">.tar.gz</code> package, you can start Elasticsearch from the
command line.</p>
<h4><a id="_run_elasticsearch_from_the_command_line"></a>Run Elasticsearch from the command line<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.7/docs/reference/setup/install/targz-start.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Run the following command to start Elasticsearch from the command line:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sh">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sh">./bin/elasticsearch</pre>
</div>
<p>When starting Elasticsearch for the first time, security features are enabled and
configured by default. The following security configuration occurs
automatically:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Authentication and authorization are enabled, and a password is generated for
the <code class="literal">elastic</code> built-in superuser.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Certificates and keys for TLS are generated for the transport and HTTP layer,
and TLS is enabled and configured with these keys and certificates.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
An enrollment token is generated for Kibana, which is valid for 30 minutes.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The password for the <code class="literal">elastic</code> user and the enrollment token for Kibana are
output to your terminal. For example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sh exclude">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sh exclude">The generated password for the elastic built-in superuser is:
&lt;password&gt;

The enrollment token for Kibana instances, valid for the next 30 minutes:
&lt;enrollment-token&gt;

The hex-encoded SHA-256 fingerprint of the generated HTTPS CA DER-encoded certificate:
&lt;fingerprint&gt;

You can complete the following actions at any time:
Reset the password of the elastic built-in superuser with
'bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic'.

Generate an enrollment token for Kibana instances with
'bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana'.

Generate an enrollment token for Elasticsearch nodes with
'bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node'.</pre>
</div>
<p>If you have password-protected the Elasticsearch keystore, you will be prompted
to enter the keystore&#8217;s password. See <a class="xref" href="secure-settings.html" title="Secure settings">Secure settings</a> for more
details.</p>
<p>By default Elasticsearch prints its logs to the console (<code class="literal">stdout</code>) and to the <code class="literal">&lt;cluster
name&gt;.log</code> file within the <a class="xref" href="important-settings.html#path-settings" title="Path settings">logs directory</a>. Elasticsearch logs some
information while it is starting, but after it has finished initializing it
will continue to run in the foreground and won&#8217;t log anything further until
something happens that is worth recording. While Elasticsearch is running you can
interact with it through its HTTP interface which is on port <code class="literal">9200</code> by default.</p>
<p>To stop Elasticsearch, press <code class="literal">Ctrl-C</code>.</p>

<div class="admon_content">
<p>All scripts packaged with Elasticsearch require a version of Bash

<p class="exclude">When Elasticsearch starts for the first time, the security auto-configuration process
binds the HTTP layer to <code class="literal">0.0.0.0</code>, but only binds the transport layer to
localhost. This intended behavior ensures that you can start
a single-node cluster with security enabled by default without any additional
configuration.</p>
<p>Before enrolling a new node, additional actions such as binding to an address
other than <code class="literal">localhost</code> or satisfying bootstrap checks are typically necessary
in production clusters. During that time, an auto-generated enrollment token
could expire, which is why enrollment tokens aren&#8217;t generated automatically.</p>
<p>Additionally, only nodes on the same host can join the cluster without
additional configuration. If you want nodes from another host to join your
cluster, you need to set <code class="literal">transport.host</code> to a

(such as uncommenting the suggested value of <code class="literal">0.0.0.0</code>), or an IP address

<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.7/modules-network.html#transport-settings" class="ulink" target="_top">transport settings</a> for more
information.</p>
<p>To enroll new nodes in your cluster, create an enrollment token with the
<code class="literal">elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token</code> tool on any existing node in your

<p>To configure Elasticsearch to start automatically when the system boots up,
run the following commands:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sh">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sh">sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
sudo /bin/systemctl enable elasticsearch.service</pre>

<p>Elasticsearch can be started and stopped as follows:</p>

<p>These commands provide no feedback as to whether Elasticsearch was started

<p>If you have password-protected your Elasticsearch keystore, you will need to provide

<h3>Startup timeouts with older <code class="literal">systemd</code> versions</h3>
<p>By default Elasticsearch sets the <code class="literal">TimeoutStartSec</code> parameter to <code class="literal">systemd</code> to <code class="literal">900s</code>. If
you are running at least version 238 of <code class="literal">systemd</code> then Elasticsearch can automatically
extend the startup timeout, and will do so repeatedly until startup is complete
even if it takes longer than 900s.</p>
<p>Versions of <code class="literal">systemd</code> prior to 238 do not support the timeout extension
mechanism and will terminate the Elasticsearch process if it has not fully started up
within the configured timeout. If this happens, Elasticsearch will report in its logs
that it was shut down normally a short time after it started:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-text">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-text">[2022-01-31T01:22:31,077][INFO ][o.e.n.Node               ] [instance-0000000123] starting ...

<p>However the <code class="literal">systemd</code> logs will report that the startup timed out:</p>

</div>
<p>To avoid this, upgrade your <code class="literal">systemd</code> to at least version 238. You can also

mechanism and will terminate the Elasticsearch process if it has not fully started up
within the configured timeout. If this happens, Elasticsearch will report in its logs
that it was shut down normally a short time after it started:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-text">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-text">[2022-01-31T01:22:31,077][INFO ][o.e.n.Node               ] [instance-0000000123] starting ...
...
[2022-01-31T01:37:15,077][INFO ][o.e.n.Node               ] [instance-0000000123] stopping ...</pre>
</div>
<p>However the <code class="literal">systemd</code> logs will report that the startup timed out:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-text">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-text">Jan 31 01:22:30 debian systemd[1]: Starting Elasticsearch...
Jan 31 01:37:15 debian systemd[1]: elasticsearch.service: Start operation timed out. Terminating.
Jan 31 01:37:15 debian systemd[1]: elasticsearch.service: Main process exited, code=killed, status=15/TERM
Jan 31 01:37:15 debian systemd[1]: elasticsearch.service: Failed with result 'timeout'.
Jan 31 01:37:15 debian systemd[1]: Failed to start Elasticsearch.</pre>
</div>
<p>To avoid this, upgrade your <code class="literal">systemd</code> to at least version 238. You can also
temporarily work around the problem by extending the <code class="literal">TimeoutStartSec</code>
parameter.</p>
