<p>Elasticsearch supports <a class="xref" href="knn-search.html#approximate-knn" title="Approximate kNN">approximate k-nearest neighbor search</a> for
efficiently finding the <em>k</em> nearest vectors to a query vector. Since
approximate kNN search works differently from other queries, there are special
considerations around its performance.</p>
<p>Many of these recommendations help improve search speed. With approximate kNN,
the indexing algorithm runs searches under the hood to create the vector index
structures. So these same recommendations also help with indexing speed.</p>
<h3><a id="_prefer_dot_product_over_cosine"></a>Prefer <code class="literal">dot_product</code> over <code class="literal">cosine</code><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.9/docs/reference/how-to/knn-search.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When indexing vectors for approximate kNN search, you need to specify the
<a class="xref" href="dense-vector.html#dense-vector-similarity"><code class="literal">similarity</code> function</a> for comparing the vectors.
If you&#8217;d like to compare vectors through cosine similarity, there are two
options.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">cosine</code> option accepts any float vector and computes the cosine
similarity. While this is convenient for testing, it&#8217;s not the most efficient
approach. Instead, we recommend using the <code class="literal">dot_product</code> option to compute the
similarity. To use <code class="literal">dot_product</code>, all vectors need to be normalized in advance
to have length 1. The <code class="literal">dot_product</code> option is significantly faster, since it
avoids performing extra vector length computations during the search.</p>
<h3><a id="_ensure_data_nodes_have_enough_memory"></a>Ensure data nodes have enough memory<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.9/docs/reference/how-to/knn-search.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elasticsearch uses the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320" class="ulink" target="_top">HNSW</a> algorithm for approximate
kNN search. HNSW is a graph-based algorithm which only works efficiently when
most vector data is held in memory. You should ensure that data nodes have at
least enough RAM to hold the vector data and index structures. To check the
size of the vector data, you can use the <a class="xref" href="indices-disk-usage.html" title="Analyze index disk usage API">Analyze index disk usage</a> API. As a
loose rule of thumb, and assuming the default HNSW options, the bytes used will
be <code class="literal">num_vectors * 4 * (num_dimensions + 12)</code>. When using the <code class="literal">byte</code> <a class="xref" href="dense-vector.html#dense-vector-element-type"><code class="literal">element_type</code></a>
the space required will be closer to  <code class="literal">num_vectors * (num_dimensions + 12)</code>. Note that
the required RAM is for the filesystem cache, which is separate from the Java
heap.</p>
<p>The data nodes should also leave a buffer for other ways that RAM is needed.
For example your index might also include text fields and numerics, which also
benefit from using filesystem cache. It&#8217;s recommended to run benchmarks with
your specific dataset to ensure there&#8217;s a sufficient amount of memory to give
good search performance.
You can find <a href="https://elasticsearch-benchmarks.elastic.co/#tracks/so_vector" class="ulink" target="_top">here</a>
and <a href="https://elasticsearch-benchmarks.elastic.co/#tracks/dense_vector" class="ulink" target="_top">here</a> some examples
of datasets and configurations that we use for our nightly benchmarks.</p>
<h3><a id="_warm_up_the_filesystem_cache_2"></a>Warm up the filesystem cache<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.9/docs/reference/how-to/search-speed.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If the machine running Elasticsearch is restarted, the filesystem cache will be
empty, so it will take some time before the operating system loads hot regions
of the index into memory so that search operations are fast. You can explicitly
tell the operating system which files should be loaded into memory eagerly
depending on the file extension using the
<a class="xref" href="preload-data-to-file-system-cache.html" title="Preloading data into the file system cache"><code class="literal">index.store.preload</code></a> setting.</p>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Loading data into the filesystem cache eagerly on too many indices or
too many files will make search <em>slower</em> if the filesystem cache is not large
enough to hold all the data. Use with caution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The following file extensions are used for the approximate kNN search:
"vec" (for vector values), "vex" (for HNSW graph), "vem" (for metadata).</p>
<h3><a id="_reduce_vector_dimensionality"></a>Reduce vector dimensionality<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.9/docs/reference/how-to/knn-search.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The speed of kNN search scales linearly with the number of vector dimensions,
because each similarity computation considers each element in the two vectors.
Whenever possible, it&#8217;s better to use vectors with a lower dimension. Some
embedding models come in different "sizes", with both lower and higher
dimensional options available. You could also experiment with dimensionality
reduction techniques like PCA. When experimenting with different approaches,
it&#8217;s important to measure the impact on relevance to ensure the search
quality is still acceptable.</p>
<h3><a id="_exclude_vector_fields_from_source"></a>Exclude vector fields from <code class="literal">_source</code><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.9/docs/reference/how-to/knn-search.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elasticsearch stores the original JSON document that was passed at index time in the
<a class="xref" href="mapping-source-field.html" title="_source field"><code class="literal">_source</code> field</a>. By default, each hit in the search
results contains the full document <code class="literal">_source</code>. When the documents contain
high-dimensional <code class="literal">dense_vector</code> fields, the <code class="literal">_source</code> can be quite large and
expensive to load. This could significantly slow down the speed of kNN search.</p>
<p>You can disable storing <code class="literal">dense_vector</code> fields in the <code class="literal">_source</code> through the
<a class="xref" href="mapping-source-field.html#include-exclude" title="Including / Excluding fields from _source"><code class="literal">excludes</code></a> mapping parameter. This prevents loading and
returning large vectors during search, and also cuts down on the index size.
Vectors that have been omitted from <code class="literal">_source</code> can still be used in kNN search,
since it relies on separate data structures to perform the search. Before
using the <a class="xref" href="mapping-source-field.html#include-exclude" title="Including / Excluding fields from _source"><code class="literal">excludes</code></a> parameter, make sure to review the
downsides of omitting fields from <code class="literal">_source</code>.</p>
<h3><a id="_reduce_the_number_of_index_segments"></a>Reduce the number of index segments<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.9/docs/reference/how-to/knn-search.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elasticsearch shards are composed of segments, which are internal storage elements in
the index. For approximate kNN search, Elasticsearch stores the dense vector values of
each segment as an HNSW graph. kNN search must check each segment, searching
through one HNSW graph after another. This means kNN search can be
significantly faster if there are fewer segments. By default, Elasticsearch periodically
merges smaller segments into larger ones through a background
<a class="xref" href="index-modules-merge.html" title="Merge">merge process</a>. If this isn&#8217;t sufficient, you can take
explicit steps to reduce the number of index segments.</p>
<h4><a id="_force_merge_to_one_segment"></a>Force merge to one segment<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.9/docs/reference/how-to/knn-search.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The <a class="xref" href="indices-forcemerge.html" title="Force merge API">force merge</a> operation forces an index merge. If you
force merge to one segment, the kNN search only need to check a single,
all-inclusive HNSW graph. Force merging <code class="literal">dense_vector</code> fields is an expensive
operation that can take significant time to complete.</p>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>We recommend only force merging a read-only index (meaning the index
is no longer receiving writes).</strong></span>  When documents are updated or deleted, the
old version is not immediately removed, but instead soft-deleted and marked
with a "tombstone". These soft-deleted documents are automatically cleaned up
during regular segment merges. But force merge can cause very large (&gt; 5GB)
segments to be produced, which are not eligible for regular merges. So the
number of soft-deleted documents can then grow rapidly, resulting in higher
disk usage and worse search performance. If you regularly force merge an index
receiving writes, this can also make snapshots more expensive, since the new
documents can&#8217;t be backed up incrementally.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4><a id="_create_large_segments_during_bulk_indexing"></a>Create large segments during bulk indexing<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.9/docs/reference/how-to/knn-search.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>A common pattern is to first perform an initial bulk upload, then make an
index available for searches. Instead of force merging, you can adjust the
index settings to encourage Elasticsearch to create larger initial segments:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Ensure there are no searches during the bulk upload and disable
<a class="xref" href="index-modules.html#index-refresh-interval-setting"><code class="literal">index.refresh_interval</code></a> by setting it to
<code class="literal">-1</code>. This prevents refresh operations and avoids creating extra segments.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Give Elasticsearch a large indexing buffer so it can accept more documents before
flushing. By default, the <a class="xref" href="indexing-buffer.html" title="Indexing buffer settings"><code class="literal">indices.memory.index_buffer_size</code></a>
is set to 10% of the heap size. With a substantial heap size like 32GB, this
is often enough. To allow the full indexing buffer to be used, you should also
increase the limit <a class="xref" href="index-modules-translog.html" title="Translog"><code class="literal">index.translog.flush_threshold_size</code></a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a id="_avoid_heavy_indexing_during_searches"></a>Avoid heavy indexing during searches<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.9/docs/reference/how-to/knn-search.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Actively indexing documents can have a negative impact on approximate kNN
search performance, since indexing threads steal compute resources from
search. When indexing and searching at the same time, Elasticsearch also refreshes
frequently, which creates several small segments. This also hurts search
performance, since approximate kNN search is slower when there are more
segments.</p>
<p>When possible, it&#8217;s best to avoid heavy indexing during approximate kNN
search. If you need to reindex all the data, perhaps because the vector
embedding model changed, then it&#8217;s better to reindex the new documents into a
separate index rather than update them in-place. This helps avoid the slowdown
mentioned above, and prevents expensive merge operations due to frequent
document updates.</p>
<h3><a id="_avoid_page_cache_thrashing_by_using_modest_readahead_values_on_linux_2"></a>Avoid page cache thrashing by using modest readahead values on Linux<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.9/docs/reference/how-to/search-speed.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Search can cause a lot of randomized read I/O. When the underlying block
device has a high readahead value, there may be a lot of unnecessary
read I/O done, especially when files are accessed using memory mapping
(see <a class="xref" href="index-modules-store.html#file-system" title="File system storage types">storage types</a>).</p>
<p>Most Linux distributions use a sensible readahead value of <code class="literal">128KiB</code> for a
single plain device, however, when using software raid, LVM or dm-crypt the
resulting block device (backing Elasticsearch <a class="xref" href="important-settings.html#path-settings" title="Path settings">path.data</a>)
may end up having a very large readahead value (in the range of several MiB).
This usually results in severe page (filesystem) cache thrashing adversely
affecting search (or <a class="xref" href="docs.html" title="Document APIs">update</a>) performance.</p>
<p>You can check the current value in <code class="literal">KiB</code> using
<code class="literal">lsblk -o NAME,RA,MOUNTPOINT,TYPE,SIZE</code>.
Consult the documentation of your distribution on how to alter this value
(for example with a <code class="literal">udev</code> rule to persist across reboots, or via
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/blockdev.8.html" class="ulink" target="_top">blockdev --setra</a>
as a transient setting). We recommend a value of <code class="literal">128KiB</code> for readahead.</p>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p><code class="literal">blockdev</code> expects values in 512 byte sectors whereas <code class="literal">lsblk</code> reports
values in <code class="literal">KiB</code>. As an example, to temporarily set readahead to <code class="literal">128KiB</code>
for <code class="literal">/dev/nvme0n1</code>, specify <code class="literal">blockdev --setra 256 /dev/nvme0n1</code>.</p>
