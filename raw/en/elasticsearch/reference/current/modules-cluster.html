<p><em>Shard allocation</em> is the process of allocating shards to nodes. This can
happen during initial recovery, replica allocation, rebalancing, or
when nodes are added or removed.</p>
<p>One of the main roles of the master is to decide which shards to allocate to
which nodes, and when to move shards between nodes in order to rebalance the
cluster.</p>
<p>There are a number of settings available to control the shard allocation process:</p>

<p>A cluster is <em>balanced</em> when it has an equal number of shards on each node, with
all nodes needing equal resources, without having a concentration of shards from
any index on any node. Elasticsearch runs an automatic process called <em>rebalancing</em> which
moves shards between the nodes in your cluster to improve its balance.
Rebalancing obeys all other shard allocation rules such as
<a class="xref" href="modules-cluster.html#cluster-shard-allocation-filtering" title="Cluster-level shard allocation filtering">allocation filtering</a> and
<a class="xref" href="modules-cluster.html#forced-awareness" title="Forced awareness">forced awareness</a> which may prevent it from completely
balancing the cluster. In that case, rebalancing strives to achieve the most
balanced cluster possible within the rules you have configured. If you are using
<a class="xref" href="data-tiers.html" title="Data tiers">data tiers</a> then Elasticsearch automatically applies allocation filtering
rules to place each shard within the appropriate tier. These rules mean that the
balancer works independently within each tier.</p>
<p>You can use the following settings to control the rebalancing of shards across
the cluster:</p>

desired locations.</p>
<p>May also be set to <code class="literal">balanced</code> to select the legacy <em>balanced allocator</em>. This
allocator was the default allocator in versions of Elasticsearch before 8.6.0. It runs
in the foreground, preventing the master from doing other work in parallel. It
works by selecting a small number of shard movements which immediately improve
the balance of the cluster, and when those shard movements complete it runs
again and selects another few shards to move. Since this allocator makes its
decisions based only on the current state of the cluster, it will sometimes
move a shard several times while balancing the cluster.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>Rebalancing works by computing a <em>weight</em> for each node based on its allocation
of shards, and then moving shards between nodes to reduce the weight of the
heavier nodes and increase the weight of the lighter ones. The cluster is
balanced when there is no possible shard movement that can bring the weight of
any node closer to the weight of any other node by more than a configurable
threshold.</p>
<p>The weight of a node depends on the number of shards it holds and on the total
estimated resource usage of those shards expressed in terms of the size of the
shard on disk and the number of threads needed to support write traffic to the
shard. Elasticsearch estimates the resource usage of shards belonging to data streams
when they are created by a rollover. The estimated disk size of the new shard
is the mean size of the other shards in the data stream. The estimated write
load of the new shard is a weighted average of the actual write loads of recent
shards in the data stream. Shards that do not belong to the write index of a
data stream have an estimated write load of zero.</p>
<p>The following settings control how Elasticsearch combines these values into an overall
measure of each node&#8217;s weight.</p>

<p><a id="disk-based-shard-allocation-description"></a>The disk-based shard allocator ensures that all nodes have enough disk space
without performing more shard movements than necessary. It allocates shards
based on a pair of thresholds known as the <em>low watermark</em> and the <em>high
watermark</em>. Its primary goal is to ensure that no node exceeds the high
watermark, or at least that any such overage is only temporary. If a node
exceeds the high watermark then Elasticsearch will solve this by moving some of its
shards onto other nodes in the cluster.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>It is normal for nodes to temporarily exceed the high watermark from time
to time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The allocator also tries to keep nodes clear of the high watermark by
forbidding the allocation of more shards to a node that exceeds the low
watermark. Importantly, if all of your nodes have exceeded the low watermark
then no new shards can be allocated and Elasticsearch will not be able to move any
shards between nodes in order to keep the disk usage below the high watermark.
You must ensure that your cluster has enough disk space in total and that there
are always some nodes below the low watermark.</p>
<p>Shard movements triggered by the disk-based shard allocator must also satisfy
all other shard allocation rules such as
<a class="xref" href="modules-cluster.html#cluster-shard-allocation-filtering" title="Cluster-level shard allocation filtering">allocation filtering</a> and
<a class="xref" href="modules-cluster.html#forced-awareness" title="Forced awareness">forced awareness</a>. If these rules are too strict then they
can also prevent the shard movements needed to keep the nodes' disk usage under
control. If you are using <a class="xref" href="data-tiers.html" title="Data tiers">data tiers</a> then Elasticsearch automatically
configures allocation filtering rules to place shards within the appropriate
tier, which means that the disk-based shard allocator works independently
within each tier.</p>
<p>If a node is filling up its disk faster than Elasticsearch can move shards elsewhere
then there is a risk that the disk will completely fill up. To prevent this, as
a last resort, once the disk usage reaches the <em>flood-stage</em> watermark Elasticsearch
will block writes to indices with a shard on the affected node. It will also
continue to move shards onto the other nodes in the cluster. When disk usage
on the affected node drops below the high watermark, Elasticsearch automatically removes
the write block. Refer to <a class="xref" href="fix-watermark-errors.html" title="Fix watermark errors">Fix watermark errors</a> to
resolve persistent watermark errors.</p>

<p>It is normal for the nodes in your cluster to be using very different amounts
of disk space. The <a class="xref" href="modules-cluster.html#shards-rebalancing-settings" title="Shard rebalancing settings">balance</a> of the cluster
depends only on the number of shards on each node and the indices to which
those shards belong. It considers neither the sizes of these shards nor the
available disk space on each node, for the following reasons:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Disk usage changes over time. Balancing the disk usage of individual nodes
would require a lot more shard movements, perhaps even wastefully undoing
earlier movements. Moving a shard consumes resources such as I/O and network
bandwidth and may evict data from the filesystem cache. These resources are
better spent handling your searches and indexing where possible.

<p>Percentage values refer to used disk space, while byte values refer to
free disk space. This can be confusing, since it flips the meaning of high and
low. For example, it makes sense to set the low watermark to 10gb and the high
watermark to 5gb, but not the other way around.</p>
</div>

<p>An example of updating the low watermark to at least 100 gigabytes free, a high
watermark of at least 50 gigabytes free, and a flood stage watermark of 10
gigabytes free, and updating the information about the cluster every minute:</p>

<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/10.console"></div>
<p>Concerning the max headroom settings for the watermarks, please note
that these apply only in the case that the watermark settings are percentages/ratios.
The aim of a max headroom value is to cap the required free disk space before hitting
the respective watermark. This is especially useful for servers with larger
disks, where a percentage/ratio watermark could translate to a big free disk space requirement,
and the max headroom can be used to cap the required free disk space amount.
As an example, let us take the default settings for the flood watermark.
It has a 95% default value, and the flood max headroom setting has a default value of 100GB.
This means that:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
For a smaller disk, e.g., of 100GB, the flood watermark will hit at 95%, meaning at 5GB
of free space, since 5GB is smaller than the 100GB max headroom value.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
For a larger disk, e.g., of 100TB, the flood watermark will hit at 100GB of free space.
That is because the 95% flood watermark alone would require 5TB of free disk space, but
that is capped by the max headroom setting to 100GB.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Finally, the max headroom settings have their default values only if their respective watermark
settings are not explicitly set (thus, they have their default percentage values).
If watermarks are explicitly set, then the max headroom settings do not have their default values,
and would need to be explicitly set if they are desired.</p>

<p>You can use custom node attributes as <em>awareness attributes</em> to enable Elasticsearch
to take your physical hardware configuration into account when allocating shards.
If Elasticsearch knows which nodes are on the same physical server, in the same rack, or
in the same zone, it can distribute the primary shard and its replica shards to
minimise the risk of losing all shard copies in the event of a failure.</p>
<p>When shard allocation awareness is enabled with the
<a class="xref" href="settings.html#dynamic-cluster-setting">dynamic</a>
<code class="literal">cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.attributes</code> setting, shards are only
allocated to nodes that have values set for the specified awareness attributes.
If you use multiple awareness attributes, Elasticsearch considers each attribute
separately when allocating shards.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The number of attribute values determines how many shard copies are

<p>To enable shard allocation awareness:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">

<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">

<p>With this example configuration, if you start two nodes with
<code class="literal">node.attr.rack_id</code> set to <code class="literal">rack_one</code> and create an index with 5 primary
shards and 1 replica of each primary, all primaries and replicas are
allocated across the two nodes.</p>
<p>If you add two nodes with <code class="literal">node.attr.rack_id</code> set to <code class="literal">rack_two</code>,
Elasticsearch moves shards to the new nodes, ensuring (if possible)
that no two copies of the same shard are in the same rack.</p>
<p>If <code class="literal">rack_two</code> fails and takes down both its nodes, by default Elasticsearch
allocates the lost shard copies to nodes in <code class="literal">rack_one</code>. To prevent multiple
copies of a particular shard from being allocated in the same location, you can
enable forced awareness.</p>
</div>

</div></div></div>
<p>By default, if one location fails, Elasticsearch assigns all of the missing
replica shards to the remaining locations. While you might have sufficient
resources across all locations to host your primary and replica shards, a single
location might be unable to host <span class="strong strong"><strong>ALL</strong></span> of the shards.</p>
<p>To prevent a single location from being overloaded in the event of a failure,
you can set <code class="literal">cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.force</code> so no replicas are
allocated until nodes are available in another location.</p>
<p>For example, if you have an awareness attribute called <code class="literal">zone</code> and configure nodes
in <code class="literal">zone1</code> and <code class="literal">zone2</code>, you can use forced awareness to prevent Elasticsearch
from allocating replicas if only one zone is available:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.attributes: zone
cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.force.zone.values: zone1,zone2 <a id="CO14-1"></a><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i></pre>
</div>
<div class="calloutlist">

</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>Specify all possible values for the awareness attribute.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>With this example configuration, if you start two nodes with <code class="literal">node.attr.zone</code> set
to <code class="literal">zone1</code> and create an index with 5 shards and 1 replica, Elasticsearch creates
the index and allocates the 5 primary shards but no replicas. Replicas are
only allocated once nodes with <code class="literal">node.attr.zone</code> set to <code class="literal">zone2</code> are available.</p>

<p>You can use cluster-level shard allocation filters to control where Elasticsearch
allocates shards from any index. These cluster wide filters are applied in
conjunction with <a class="xref" href="shard-allocation-filtering.html" title="Index-level shard allocation filtering">per-index allocation filtering</a>
and <a class="xref" href="modules-cluster.html#shard-allocation-awareness" title="Shard allocation awareness">allocation awareness</a>.</p>
<p>Shard allocation filters can be based on custom node attributes or the built-in
<code class="literal">_name</code>, <code class="literal">_host_ip</code>, <code class="literal">_publish_ip</code>, <code class="literal">_ip</code>, <code class="literal">_host</code>, <code class="literal">_id</code> and <code class="literal">_tier</code> attributes.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">cluster.routing.allocation</code> settings are <a class="xref" href="settings.html#dynamic-cluster-setting">dynamic</a>, enabling live indices to
be moved from one set of nodes to another. Shards are only relocated if it is
possible to do so without breaking another routing constraint, such as never
allocating a primary and replica shard on the same node.</p>
<p>The most common use case for cluster-level shard allocation filtering is when
you want to decommission a node. To move shards off of a node prior to shutting
it down, you could create a filter that excludes the node by its IP address:</p>
