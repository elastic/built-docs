<p>A rolling upgrade allows an Elasticsearch cluster to be upgraded one node at
a time so upgrading does not interrupt service. Running multiple versions of
Elasticsearch in the same cluster beyond the duration of an upgrade is
not supported, as shards cannot be replicated from upgraded nodes to nodes
running the older version.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that when you upgrade you divide your cluster&#8217;s nodes
into the following two groups and upgrade the groups in this order:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Nodes that are not <a class="xref" href="modules-node.html#master-node" title="Master-eligible node">master-eligible</a>. You can retrieve a list
of these nodes with <code class="literal">GET /_nodes/_all,master:false</code> or by finding all the nodes
configured with <code class="literal">node.master: false</code>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Master-eligible nodes, which are the remaining nodes. You can retrieve a list
of these nodes with <code class="literal">GET /_nodes/master:true</code>.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>You may upgrade the nodes within each of these groups in any order.</p>
<p>Upgrading the nodes in this order ensures that the master-ineligible nodes are
always running a version at least as new as the master-eligible nodes. Newer
nodes can always join a cluster with an older master, but older nodes cannot
always join a cluster with a newer master. By upgrading the master-eligible
nodes last you ensure that all the master-ineligible nodes will be able to join
the cluster whether the master-eligible nodes have been upgraded or not. If you
upgrade any master-eligible nodes before the master-ineligible nodes then there
is a risk that the older nodes will leave the cluster and will not be able to
rejoin until they have been upgraded.</p>
<p>Rolling upgrades are supported:</p>

<p>It is important to prepare carefully before starting an upgrade. Once you have
started to upgrade your cluster to version 7.10.1 you must complete the
upgrade. As soon as the cluster contains nodes of version 7.10.1 it may make
changes to its internal state that cannot be reverted. If you cannot complete
the upgrade then you should discard the partially-upgraded cluster, deploy an
empty cluster of the version before the upgrade, and restore its contents from
a snapshot.</p>
<p>Before you start to upgrade your cluster to version 7.10.1 you should do the
following.</p>

<div class="olist orderedlist">

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Disable shard allocation</strong></span>.</p>
<p>When you shut down a node, the allocation process waits for
<code class="literal">index.unassigned.node_left.delayed_timeout</code> (by default, one minute) before
starting to replicate the shards on that node to other nodes in the cluster,
which can involve a lot of I/O.  Since the node is shortly going to be
restarted, this I/O is unnecessary. You can avoid racing the clock by
<a class="xref" href="modules-cluster.html#cluster-routing-allocation-enable">disabling allocation</a> of replicas before
shutting down the node:</p>

<p>While you can continue indexing during the upgrade, shard recovery
is much faster if you temporarily stop non-essential indexing and perform a

<p>When you perform a synced flush, check the response to make sure there are
no failures. Synced flush operations that fail due to pending indexing
operations are listed in the response body, although the request itself
still returns a 200 OK status. If there are failures, reissue the request.</p>
<p>Note that synced flush is deprecated and will be removed in 8.0. A flush
has the same effect as a synced flush on Elasticsearch 7.6 or later.</p>
