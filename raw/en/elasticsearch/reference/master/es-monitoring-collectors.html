<p>Elastic Agent and Metricbeat are the recommended methods for collecting and shipping
monitoring data to a monitoring cluster.</p>
<p>If you have previously configured legacy collection methods, you should migrate
to using <a class="xref" href="configuring-elastic-agent.html" title="Collecting Elasticsearch monitoring data with Elastic Agent">Elastic Agent</a> or
<a class="xref" href="configuring-metricbeat.html" title="Collecting Elasticsearch monitoring data with Metricbeat">Metricbeat</a> collection. Do not use legacy collection
alongside other collection methods.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Collectors, as their name implies, collect things. Each collector runs once for
each collection interval to obtain data from the public APIs in Elasticsearch and X-Pack
that it chooses to monitor. When the data collection is finished, the data is
handed in bulk to the <a class="xref" href="es-monitoring-exporters.html" title="Exporters">exporters</a> to be sent to the
monitoring clusters. Regardless of the number of exporters, each collector only
runs once per collection interval.</p>
<p>There is only one collector per data type gathered. In other words, for any
monitoring document that is created, it comes from a single collector rather
than being merged from multiple collectors. The Elasticsearch monitoring features
currently have a few collectors because the goal is to minimize overlap between
them for optimal performance.</p>
<p>Each collector can create zero or more monitoring documents. For example,
the <code class="literal">index_stats</code> collector collects all index statistics at the same time to
avoid many unnecessary calls.</p>

to X-Pack 5.5, this was actually three separate collectors that resulted in
three separate types: <code class="literal">cluster_stats</code>, <code class="literal">cluster_state</code>, and <code class="literal">cluster_info</code>. In
5.5 and later, all three are combined into <code class="literal">cluster_stats</code>. This only runs on
the <em>elected</em> master node and the data collected (<code class="literal">cluster_stats</code>) largely
controls the UI. When this data is not present, it indicates either a
misconfiguration on the elected master node, timeouts related to the collection
of the data, or issues with storing the data. Only a single document is produced

stats request due to too many segment files. As a result, the collector spends
too much time waiting for the file system stats to be calculated until it
finally times out. A single <code class="literal">node_stats</code> document is created per collection.
This is collected per node to help to discover issues with nodes communicating
with each other, but not with the monitoring cluster (for example, intermittent
network issues or memory pressure).</p></td>

<p>The Elasticsearch monitoring features use a single threaded scheduler to run the
collection of Elasticsearch monitoring data by all of the appropriate collectors on each
node. This scheduler is managed locally by each node and its interval is
controlled by specifying the <code class="literal">xpack.monitoring.collection.interval</code>, which
defaults to 10 seconds (<code class="literal">10s</code>), at either the node or cluster level.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, each collector works on the same principle. Per collection
interval, each collector is checked to see whether it should run and then the
appropriate collectors run. The failure of an individual collector does not
impact any other collector.</p>
<p>Once collection has completed, all of the monitoring data is passed to the
exporters to route the monitoring data to the monitoring clusters.</p>
<p>If gaps exist in the monitoring charts in Kibana, it is typically because either
a collector failed or the monitoring cluster did not receive the data (for
example, it was being restarted). In the event that a collector fails, a logged
error should exist on the node that attempted to perform the collection.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Collection is currently done serially, rather than in parallel, to avoid
      extra overhead on the elected master node. The downside to this approach
      is that collectors might observe a different version of the cluster state
      within the same collection period. In practice, this does not make a
      significant difference and running the collectors in parallel would not
      prevent such a possibility.</p>

<h5><a id="es-monitoring-stack"></a>Collecting data from across the Elastic Stack<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/monitoring/collectors.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>Elasticsearch monitoring features also receive monitoring data from other parts of the
Elastic Stack. In this way, it serves as an unscheduled monitoring data
collector for the stack.</p>
<p>By default, data collection is disabled. Elasticsearch monitoring data is not
collected and all monitoring data from other sources such as Kibana, Beats, and
Logstash is ignored. You must set <code class="literal">xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled</code> to <code class="literal">true</code>
to enable the collection of monitoring data. See <a class="xref" href="monitoring-settings.html" title="Monitoring settings in Elasticsearch">Monitoring settings</a>.</p>
<p>Once data is received, it is forwarded to the exporters
to be routed to the monitoring cluster like all monitoring data.</p>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Because this stack-level "collector" lives outside of the collection
interval of Elasticsearch monitoring features, it is not impacted by the
<code class="literal">xpack.monitoring.collection.interval</code> setting. Therefore, data is passed to the
exporters whenever it is received. This behavior can result in indices for Kibana,
Logstash, or Beats being created somewhat unexpectedly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>While the monitoring data is collected and processed, some production cluster
metadata is added to incoming documents. This metadata enables Kibana to link the
monitoring data to the appropriate cluster. If this linkage is unimportant to
the infrastructure that you&#8217;re monitoring, it might be simpler to configure
Logstash and Beats to report monitoring data directly to the monitoring cluster.
This scenario also prevents the production cluster from adding extra overhead
related to monitoring data, which can be very useful when there are a large
number of Logstash nodes or Beats.</p>
