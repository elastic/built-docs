<p>A <em>runtime field</em> is a field that is evaluated at query time. Runtime fields
enable you to:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Add fields to existing documents without reindexing your data
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Start working with your data without understanding how it’s structured
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Override the value returned from an indexed field at query time
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Define fields for a specific use without modifying the underlying schema
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You access runtime fields from the search API like any other field, and Elasticsearch
sees runtime fields no differently. You can define runtime fields in the
<a class="xref" href="runtime-mapping-fields.html" title="Map a runtime field">index mapping</a> or in the
<a class="xref" href="runtime-search-request.html" title="Define runtime fields in a search request">search request</a>. Your choice, which is part of the
inherent flexibility of runtime fields.</p>
<p>Use the <a class="xref" href="search-fields.html" title="Retrieve selected fields from a search"><code class="literal">fields</code></a> parameter on the <code class="literal">_search</code> API to
<a class="xref" href="runtime-retrieving-fields.html" title="Retrieve a runtime field">retrieve the values of runtime fields</a>. Runtime
fields won&#8217;t display in <code class="literal">_source</code>, but the <code class="literal">fields</code> API works for all fields,
even those that were not sent as part of the original <code class="literal">_source</code>.</p>
<p>Runtime fields are useful when working with log data
(see <a class="xref" href="runtime-examples.html" title="Explore your data with runtime fields">examples</a>), especially when you&#8217;re unsure about the
data structure. Your search speed decreases, but your index size is much
smaller and you can more quickly process logs without having to index them.</p>
<h3><a id="runtime-benefits"></a>Benefits<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/mapping/runtime.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Because runtime fields aren&#8217;t indexed, adding a runtime field doesn&#8217;t increase
the index size. You define runtime fields directly in the index mapping, saving
storage costs and increasing ingestion speed. You can more quickly ingest
data into the Elastic Stack and access it right away. When you define a runtime
field, you can immediately use it in search requests, aggregations, filtering,
and sorting.</p>
<p>If you change a runtime field into an indexed field, you don&#8217;t need to modify
any queries that refer to the runtime field. Better yet, you can refer to some
indices where the field is a runtime field, and other indices where the field
is an indexed field. You have the flexibility to choose which fields to index
and which ones to keep as runtime fields.</p>
<p>At its core, the most important benefit of runtime fields is the ability to
add fields to documents after you&#8217;ve ingested them. This capability simplifies
mapping decisions because you don&#8217;t have to decide how to parse your data up
front, and can use runtime fields to amend the mapping at any time. Using
runtime fields allows for a smaller index and faster ingest time, which
combined use less resources and reduce your operating costs.</p>
<h3><a id="runtime-incentives"></a>Incentives<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/mapping/runtime.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Runtime fields can replace many of the ways you can use scripting with the
<code class="literal">_search</code> API. How you use a runtime field is impacted by the number of
documents that the included script runs against. For example, if you&#8217;re using
the <code class="literal">fields</code> parameter on the <code class="literal">_search</code> API to
<a class="xref" href="runtime-retrieving-fields.html" title="Retrieve a runtime field">retrieve the values of a runtime field</a>, the script
runs only against the top hits just like script fields do.</p>
<p>You can use <a class="xref" href="search-fields.html#script-fields" title="Script fields">script fields</a> to access values in <code class="literal">_source</code> and
return calculated values based on a script valuation. Runtime fields have the
same capabilities, but provide greater flexibility because you can query and
aggregate on runtime fields in a search request. Script fields can only fetch
values.</p>
<p>Similarly, you could write a <a class="xref" href="query-dsl-script-query.html" title="Script query">script query</a> that
filters documents in a search request based on a script. Runtime fields provide
a very similar feature that is more flexible. You write a script to create
field values and they are available everywhere, such as
<a class="xref" href="search-fields.html" title="Retrieve selected fields from a search"><code class="literal">fields</code></a>, <a class="xref" href="query-dsl.html" title="Query DSL">all queries</a>, and
<a class="xref" href="search-aggregations.html" title="Aggregations">aggregations</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use scripts to <a class="xref" href="sort-search-results.html#script-based-sorting" title="Script Based Sorting">sort search results</a>, but
that same script works exactly the same in a runtime field.</p>
<p>If you move a script from any of these sections in a search request to a
runtime field that is computing values from the same number of documents, the
performance should be about the same. The performance for these features is
largely dependent upon the calculations that the included script is running and
how many documents the script runs against.</p>
<h3><a id="runtime-compromises"></a>Compromises<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/mapping/runtime.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Runtime fields use less disk space and provide flexibility in how you access
your data, but can impact search performance based on the computation defined in
the runtime script.</p>
<p>To balance search performance and flexibility, index fields that you&#8217;ll
frequently search for and filter on, such as a timestamp. Elasticsearch automatically
uses these indexed fields first when running a query, resulting in a fast
response time. You can then use runtime fields to limit the number of fields
that Elasticsearch needs to calculate values for. Using indexed fields in tandem with
runtime fields provides flexibility in the data that you index and how you
define queries for other fields.</p>
<p>Use the <a class="xref" href="async-search.html" title="Async search">asynchronous search API</a> to run searches that include
runtime fields. This method of search helps to offset the performance impacts
of computing values for runtime fields in each document containing that field.
If the query can&#8217;t return the result set synchronously, you&#8217;ll get results
asynchronously as they become available.</p>

<p>Queries against runtime fields are considered expensive. If
<a class="xref" href="query-dsl.html#query-dsl-allow-expensive-queries"><code class="literal">search.allow_expensive_queries</code></a> is set
to <code class="literal">false</code>, expensive queries are not allowed and Elasticsearch will reject any queries
against runtime fields.</p>
