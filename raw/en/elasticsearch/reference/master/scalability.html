<p>Many teams rely on Elasticsearch to run their key services. To keep these services running, you can design your Elasticsearch deployment
to keep Elasticsearch available, even in case of large-scale outages. To keep it running fast, you also can design your
deployment to be responsive to production workloads.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch is built to be always available and to scale with your needs. It does this using a distributed architecture.
By distributing your cluster, you can keep Elastic online and responsive to requests.</p>
<p>In case of failure, Elasticsearch offers tools for cross-cluster replication and cluster snapshots that can
help you fall back or recover quickly. You can also use cross-cluster replication to serve requests based on the
geographic location of your users and your resources.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch also offers security and monitoring tools to help you keep your cluster highly available.</p>

<p>When you move to production, you need to introduce multiple nodes and shards to your cluster. Nodes and shards are what make Elasticsearch distributed and scalable. The size and number of these nodes and shards depends on your data, your use case, and your budget.</p>
<p>These concepts aren&#8217;t essential if you&#8217;re just getting started. How you <a class="xref" href="elasticsearch-intro-deploy.html" title="Run Elasticsearch">deploy Elasticsearch</a> in production determines what you need to know:</p>

<span class="strong strong"><strong>Self-managed Elasticsearch</strong></span>: You are responsible for setting up and managing nodes, clusters, shards, and replicas. This includes
managing the underlying infrastructure, scaling, and ensuring high availability through failover and backup strategies.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Cloud</strong></span>: Elastic can autoscale resources in response to workload changes. Choose from different deployment types
to apply sensible defaults for your use case. A basic understanding of nodes, shards, and replicas is still important.

<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Cloud Serverless</strong></span>: You don&#8217;t need to worry about nodes, shards, or replicas. These resources are 100% automated

<p>To effectively distribute read and write operations across nodes, the nodes in a cluster need good, reliable connections
to each other. To provide better connections, you typically co-locate the nodes in the same data center or nearby data centers.</p>
<p>Co-locating nodes in a single location exposes you to the risk of a single outage taking your entire cluster offline. To
maintain high availability, you can prepare a second cluster that can take over in case of disaster by implementing
cross-cluster replication (CCR).</p>
<p>CCR provides a way to automatically synchronize indices from your primary cluster to a secondary remote cluster that
can serve as a hot backup. If the primary cluster fails, the secondary cluster can take over.</p>
<p>You can also use CCR to create secondary clusters to serve read requests in geo-proximity to your users.</p>

<p>As with any enterprise system, you need tools to secure, manage, and monitor your Elasticsearch clusters. Security,
monitoring, and administrative features that are integrated into Elasticsearch enable you to use <a href="/guide/en/kibana/master/introduction.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana</a> as a

<p>Elasticsearch offers many options that allow you to configure your cluster to meet your organization’s goals, requirements,
and restrictions. You can review the following guides to learn how to tune your cluster to meet your needs:</p>
