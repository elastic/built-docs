<p>Searchable snapshots let you use <a class="xref" href="snapshot-restore.html" title="Snapshot and restore">snapshots</a> to search
infrequently accessed and read-only data in a very cost-effective fashion. The
<a class="xref" href="data-tiers.html#cold-tier" title="Cold tier">cold</a> and <a class="xref" href="data-tiers.html#frozen-tier" title="Frozen tier">frozen</a> data tiers use searchable snapshots to
reduce your storage and operating costs.</p>
<p>Searchable snapshots eliminate the need for <a class="xref" href="scalability.html" title="Scalability and resilience: clusters, nodes, and shards">replica shards</a> after
rolling over from the hot tier, potentially halving the local storage needed to
search your data. Searchable snapshots rely on the same snapshot mechanism you
already use for backups and have minimal impact on your snapshot repository
storage costs.</p>
<h3><a id="using-searchable-snapshots"></a>Using searchable snapshots<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/searchable-snapshots/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Searching a searchable snapshot index is the same as searching any other index.</p>
<p>By default, searchable snapshot indices have no replicas. The underlying snapshot
provides resilience and the query volume is expected to be low enough that a
single shard copy will be sufficient. However, if you need to support a higher
query volume, you can add replicas by adjusting the <code class="literal">index.number_of_replicas</code>
index setting.</p>
<p>If a node fails and searchable snapshot shards need to be recovered elsewhere, there
is a brief window of time while Elasticsearch allocates the shards to other nodes where
the cluster health will not be <code class="literal">green</code>. Searches that hit these shards may fail
or return partial results until the shards are reallocated to healthy nodes.</p>
<p>You typically manage searchable snapshots through ILM. The
<a class="xref" href="ilm-searchable-snapshot.html" title="Searchable snapshot">searchable snapshots</a> action automatically converts
a regular index into a searchable snapshot index when it reaches the <code class="literal">cold</code> or
<code class="literal">frozen</code> phase. You can also make indices in existing snapshots searchable by
manually mounting them using the <a class="xref" href="searchable-snapshots-api-mount-snapshot.html" title="Mount snapshot API">mount snapshot</a> API.</p>
<p>To mount an index from a snapshot that contains multiple indices, we recommend
creating a <a class="xref" href="clone-snapshot-api.html" title="Clone snapshot API">clone</a> of the snapshot that contains only the
index you want to search, and mounting the clone. You should not delete a
snapshot if it has any mounted indices, so creating a clone enables you to
manage the lifecycle of the backup snapshot independently of any searchable snapshots.
If you use ILM to manage your searchable snapshots then it will automatically
look after cloning the snapshot as needed.</p>
<p>You can control the allocation of the shards of searchable snapshot indices using the
same mechanisms as for regular indices. For example, you could use
<a class="xref" href="shard-allocation-filtering.html" title="Index-level shard allocation filtering">Index-level shard allocation filtering</a> to restrict searchable snapshot shards to a subset of
your nodes.</p>
<p>The speed of recovery of a searchable snapshot index is limited by the repository
setting <code class="literal">max_restore_bytes_per_sec</code> and the node setting
<code class="literal">indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec</code> just like a normal restore operation. By
default <code class="literal">max_restore_bytes_per_sec</code> is unlimited, but the default for
<code class="literal">indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec</code> depends on the configuration of the node.
See <a class="xref" href="recovery.html#recovery-settings" title="Recovery settings">Recovery settings</a>.</p>
<p>We recommend that you <a class="xref" href="indices-forcemerge.html" title="Force merge API">force-merge</a> indices to a single
segment per shard before taking a snapshot that will be mounted as a
searchable snapshot index. Each read from a snapshot repository takes time and costs
money, and the fewer segments there are the fewer reads are needed to restore
the snapshot or to respond to a search.</p>

<p>Searchable snapshots are ideal for managing a large archive of historical data.
Historical information is typically searched less frequently than recent data
and therefore may not need replicas for their performance benefits.</p>

<h3><a id="how-searchable-snapshots-work"></a>How searchable snapshots work<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/searchable-snapshots/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When an index is mounted from a snapshot, Elasticsearch allocates its shards to data
nodes within the cluster. The data nodes then automatically retrieve the
relevant shard data from the repository onto local storage, based on the
<a class="xref" href="searchable-snapshots.html#searchable-snapshot-mount-storage-options" title="Mount options">mount options</a> specified. If
possible, searches use data from local storage. If the data is not available
locally, Elasticsearch downloads the data that it needs from the snapshot repository.</p>
<p>If a node holding one of these shards fails, Elasticsearch automatically allocates the
affected shards on another node, and that node restores the relevant shard data
from the repository. No replicas are needed, and no complicated monitoring or
orchestration is necessary to restore lost shards. Although searchable snapshot
indices have no replicas by default, you may add replicas to these indices by
adjusting <code class="literal">index.number_of_replicas</code>. Replicas of searchable snapshot shards are
recovered by copying data from the snapshot repository, just like primaries of
searchable snapshot shards. In contrast, replicas of regular indices are restored by
copying data from the primary.</p>
<h4><a id="searchable-snapshot-mount-storage-options"></a>Mount options<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/searchable-snapshots/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>To search a snapshot, you must first mount it locally as an index. Usually
ILM will do this automatically, but you can also call the
<a class="xref" href="searchable-snapshots-api-mount-snapshot.html" title="Mount snapshot API">mount snapshot</a> API yourself. There
are two options for mounting an index from a snapshot, each with different
performance characteristics and local storage footprints:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<a id="fully-mounted"></a>
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Fully mounted index
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Fully caches the snapshotted index&#8217;s shards in the Elasticsearch cluster. ILM uses
this option in the <code class="literal">hot</code> and <code class="literal">cold</code> phases.
</p>
<p>Search performance for a fully mounted index is normally comparable to a regular
index, since there is minimal need to access the snapshot repository. While
recovery is ongoing, search performance may be slower than with a regular index
because a search may need some data that has not yet been retrieved into the
local cache. If that happens, Elasticsearch will eagerly retrieve the data needed to
complete the search in parallel with the ongoing recovery. On-disk data is
preserved across restarts, such that the node does not need to re-download data
that is already stored on the node after a restart.</p>
<p>Indices managed by ILM are prefixed with <code class="literal">restored-</code> when fully mounted.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="variablelist">
<a id="partially-mounted"></a>
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Partially mounted index
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Uses a local cache containing only recently searched parts of the snapshotted
index&#8217;s data. This cache has a fixed size and is shared across shards of
partially mounted indices allocated on the same data node. ILM uses this
option in the <code class="literal">frozen</code> phase.
</p>
<p>If a search requires data that is not in the cache, Elasticsearch fetches the missing
data from the snapshot repository. Searches that require these fetches are
slower, but the fetched data is stored in the cache so that similar searches can
be served more quickly in future. Elasticsearch will evict infrequently used data from
the cache to free up space. The cache is cleared when a node is restarted.</p>
<p>Although slower than a fully mounted index or a regular index, a partially
mounted index still returns search results quickly, even for large data sets,
because the layout of data in the repository is heavily optimized for search.
Many searches will need to retrieve only a small subset of the total shard data
before returning results.</p>
<p>Indices managed by ILM are prefixed with <code class="literal">partial-</code> when partially
mounted.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>To partially mount an index, you must have one or more nodes with a shared cache
available. By default, dedicated frozen data tier nodes (nodes with the
<code class="literal">data_frozen</code> role and no other data roles) have a shared cache configured using
the greater of 90% of total disk space and total disk space subtracted a
headroom of 100GB.</p>
<p>Using a dedicated frozen tier is highly recommended for production use. If you
do not have a dedicated frozen tier, you must configure the
<code class="literal">xpack.searchable.snapshot.shared_cache.size</code> setting to reserve space for the
cache on one or more nodes. Partially mounted indices are only allocated to
nodes that have a shared cache.</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<a id="searchable-snapshots-shared-cache"></a>
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">xpack.searchable.snapshot.shared_cache.size</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
(<a class="xref" href="settings.html#static-cluster-setting">Static</a>)
Disk space reserved for the shared cache of partially mounted indices. Accepts a
percentage of total disk space or an absolute <a class="xref" href="api-conventions.html#byte-units" title="Byte size units">byte value</a>.
Defaults to <code class="literal">90%</code> of total disk space for dedicated frozen data tier nodes.
Otherwise defaults to <code class="literal">0b</code>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">xpack.searchable.snapshot.shared_cache.size.max_headroom</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
(<a class="xref" href="settings.html#static-cluster-setting">Static</a>, <a class="xref" href="api-conventions.html#byte-units" title="Byte size units">byte value</a>)
For dedicated frozen tier nodes, the max headroom to maintain. If
<code class="literal">xpack.searchable.snapshot.shared_cache.size</code> is not explicitly set, this
setting defaults to <code class="literal">100GB</code>. Otherwise it defaults to <code class="literal">-1</code> (not set). You can
only configure this setting if <code class="literal">xpack.searchable.snapshot.shared_cache.size</code> is
set as a percentage.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>To illustrate how these settings work in concert let us look at two examples
when using the default values of the settings on a dedicated frozen node:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
A 4000 GB disk will result in a shared cache sized at 3900 GB. 90% of 4000 GB
is 3600 GB, leaving 400 GB headroom. The default <code class="literal">max_headroom</code> of 100 GB takes
effect, and the result is therefore 3900 GB.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
A 400 GB disk will result in a shared cache sized at 360 GB.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You can configure the settings in <code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code>:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">xpack.searchable.snapshot.shared_cache.size: 4TB</pre>
</div>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>You can only configure these settings on nodes with the
<a class="xref" href="modules-node.html#data-frozen-node" title="Frozen data node"><code class="literal">data_frozen</code></a> role. Additionally, nodes with a shared cache
can only have a single <a class="xref" href="important-settings.html#path-settings" title="Path settings">data path</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Elasticsearch also uses a dedicated system index named <code class="literal">.snapshot-blob-cache</code> to speed up
the recoveries of searchable snapshot shards. This index is used as an additional
caching layer on top of the partially or fully mounted data and contains the
minimal required data to start the searchable snapshot shards. Elasticsearch automatically
deletes the documents that are no longer used in this index. This periodic clean
up can be tuned using the following settings:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">

<h3><a id="searchable-snapshots-costs"></a>Reduce costs with searchable snapshots<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/searchable-snapshots/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, searchable snapshots reduce the costs of running a cluster by removing
the need for replica shards  and for shard data to be copied between nodes.
However, if it&#8217;s particularly expensive to retrieve data from a snapshot
repository in your environment, searchable snapshots may be more costly than regular
indices. Ensure that the cost structure of your operating environment is
compatible with searchable snapshots before using them.</p>
<h4><a id="searchable-snapshots-costs-replicas"></a>Replica costs<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/searchable-snapshots/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>For resiliency, a regular index requires multiple redundant copies of each shard
across multiple nodes. If a node fails, Elasticsearch uses the redundancy to rebuild any
lost shard copies. A searchable snapshot index doesn&#8217;t require replicas. If a node
containing a searchable snapshot index fails, Elasticsearch can rebuild the lost shard cache
from the snapshot repository.</p>
<p>Without replicas, rarely-accessed searchable snapshot indices require far fewer
resources. A cold data tier that contains replica-free fully-mounted
searchable snapshot indices requires half the nodes and disk space of a tier
containing the same data in regular indices. The frozen tier, which contains
only partially-mounted searchable snapshot indices, requires even fewer resources.</p>
<h4><a id="snapshot-retrieval-costs"></a>Data transfer costs<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/searchable-snapshots/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>When a shard of a regular index is moved between nodes, its contents are copied
from another node in your cluster. In many environments, the costs of moving
data between nodes are significant, especially if running in a Cloud environment
with nodes in different zones. In contrast, when mounting a searchable snapshot index
or moving one of its shards, the data is always copied from the snapshot
repository. This is typically much cheaper.</p>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Most cloud providers charge significant fees for data transferred
between regions and for data transferred out of their platforms. You should only
mount snapshots into a cluster that is in the same region as the snapshot
repository. If you wish to search data across multiple regions, configure
multiple clusters and use <a class="xref" href="modules-cross-cluster-search.html" title="Search across clusters">cross-cluster search</a> or
<a class="xref" href="xpack-ccr.html" title="Cross-cluster replication">cross-cluster replication</a> instead of searchable snapshots.</p>

<h3><a id="back-up-restore-searchable-snapshots"></a>Back up and restore searchable snapshots<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/searchable-snapshots/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You can use <a class="xref" href="snapshots-take-snapshot.html" title="Create a snapshot">regular snapshots</a> to back up a cluster
containing searchable snapshot indices. When you restore a snapshot containing
searchable snapshot indices, these indices are restored as searchable snapshot indices
again.</p>
<p>Before you restore a snapshot containing a searchable snapshot index, you must first
<a class="xref" href="snapshots-register-repository.html" title="Register a snapshot repository">register the repository</a> containing the
original index snapshot. When restored, the searchable snapshot index mounts the
original index snapshot from its original repository. If wanted, you can use
separate repositories for regular snapshots and searchable snapshots.</p>
<p>A snapshot of a searchable snapshot index contains only a small amount of metadata
which identifies its original index snapshot. It does not contain any data from
the original index. The restore of a backup will fail to restore any
searchable snapshot indices whose original index snapshot is unavailable.</p>
<p>Because searchable snapshot indices are not regular indices, it is not possible to use
a <a class="xref" href="snapshots-source-only-repository.html" title="Source-only repository">source-only repository</a> to take snapshots
of searchable snapshot indices.</p>
<h3><a id="searchable-snapshots-reliability"></a>Reliability of searchable snapshots<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/searchable-snapshots/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The sole copy of the data in a searchable snapshot index is the underlying snapshot,
stored in the repository. For example:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You cannot unregister a repository while any of the searchable snapshots it
contains are mounted in Elasticsearch. You also cannot delete a snapshot if any of its
indices are mounted as a searchable snapshot in the same cluster.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you mount indices from snapshots held in a repository to which a different
cluster has write access then you must make sure that the other cluster does not
delete these snapshots.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you delete a snapshot while it is mounted as a searchable snapshot then the
data is lost. Similarly, if the repository fails or corrupts the contents of the
snapshot then the data is lost.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Although Elasticsearch may have cached the data onto local storage, these caches may be
incomplete and cannot be used to recover any data after a repository failure.
You must make sure that your repository is reliable and protects against
corruption of your data while it is at rest in the repository.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The blob storage offered by all major public cloud providers typically offers
very good protection against data loss or corruption. If you manage your own
repository storage then you are responsible for its reliability.</p>
