<p>Normally, a node will only leave a cluster if deliberately shut down. If a node
leaves the cluster unexpectedly, it&#8217;s important to address the cause. A cluster
in which nodes leave unexpectedly is unstable and can create several issues.
For instance:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The cluster health may be yellow or red.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Some shards will be initializing and other shards may be failing.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Search, indexing, and monitoring operations may fail and report exceptions in
logs.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The <code class="literal">.security</code> index may be unavailable, blocking access to the cluster.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The master may appear busy due to frequent cluster state updates.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To troubleshoot a cluster in this state, first ensure the cluster has a
<a class="xref" href="discovery-troubleshooting.html" title="Troubleshooting discovery">stable master</a>. Next, focus on the nodes
unexpectedly leaving the cluster ahead of all other issues. It will not be
possible to solve other issues until the cluster has a stable master node and
stable node membership.</p>
<p>Diagnostics and statistics are usually not useful in an unstable cluster. These
tools only offer a view of the state of the cluster at a single point in time.
Instead, look at the cluster logs to see the pattern of behaviour over time.
Focus particularly on logs from the elected master. When a node leaves the
cluster, logs for the elected master include a message like this (with line
breaks added to make it easier to read):</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-text">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-text">[2022-03-21T11:02:35,513][INFO ][o.e.c.c.NodeLeftExecutor] [instance-0000000000]

</div>
<p>This message says that the <code class="literal">NodeLeftExecutor</code> on the elected master
(<code class="literal">instance-0000000000</code>) processed a <code class="literal">node-left</code> task, identifying the node that
was removed and the reason for its removal. When the node joins the cluster
again, logs for the elected master will include a message like this (with line
breaks added to make it easier to read):</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-text">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-text">[2022-03-21T11:02:59,892][INFO ][o.e.c.c.NodeJoinExecutor] [instance-0000000000]

</div>
<p>This message says that the <code class="literal">NodeJoinExecutor</code> on the elected master
(<code class="literal">instance-0000000000</code>) processed a <code class="literal">node-join</code> task, identifying the node that
was added to the cluster and the reason for the task.</p>
<p>Other nodes may log similar messages, but report fewer details:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-text">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-text">[2020-01-29T11:02:36,985][INFO ][o.e.c.s.ClusterApplierService]

    }, term: 14, version: 1653415, reason: Publication{term=14, version=1653415}</pre>
</div>
<p>These messages are not especially useful for troubleshooting, so focus on the
ones from the <code class="literal">NodeLeftExecutor</code> and <code class="literal">NodeJoinExecutor</code> which are only emitted
on the elected master and which contain more details. If you don&#8217;t see the
messages from the <code class="literal">NodeLeftExecutor</code> and <code class="literal">NodeJoinExecutor</code>, check that:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You&#8217;re looking at the logs for the elected master node.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The logs cover the correct time period.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Logging is enabled at <code class="literal">INFO</code> level.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Nodes will also log a message containing <code class="literal">master node changed</code> whenever they
start or stop following the elected master. You can use these messages to
determine each node&#8217;s view of the state of the master over time.</p>
<p>If a node restarts, it will leave the cluster and then join the cluster again.
When it rejoins, the <code class="literal">NodeJoinExecutor</code> will log that it processed a
<code class="literal">node-join</code> task indicating that the node is <code class="literal">joining after restart</code>. If a node
is unexpectedly restarting, look at the node&#8217;s logs to see why it is shutting
down.</p>
<p>The <a class="xref" href="health-api.html" title="Health API">Health</a> API on the affected node will also provide some useful
information about the situation.</p>
<p>If the node did not restart then you should look at the reason for its
departure more closely. Each reason has different troubleshooting steps,
described below. There are three possible reasons:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">disconnected</code>: The connection from the master node to the removed node was
closed.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">lagging</code>: The master published a cluster state update, but the removed node
did not apply it within the permitted timeout. By default, this timeout is 2
minutes. Refer to <a class="xref" href="modules-discovery-settings.html" title="Discovery and cluster formation settings">Discovery and cluster formation settings</a> for information about the
settings which control this mechanism.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">followers check retry count exceeded</code>: The master sent a number of
consecutive health checks to the removed node. These checks were rejected or
timed out. By default, each health check times out after 10 seconds and Elasticsearch
removes the node removed after three consecutively failed health checks. Refer
to <a class="xref" href="modules-discovery-settings.html" title="Discovery and cluster formation settings">Discovery and cluster formation settings</a> for information about the settings which
control this mechanism.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a id="_diagnosing_disconnected_nodes_2"></a>Diagnosing <code class="literal">disconnected</code> nodes<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/modules/discovery/fault-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Nodes typically leave the cluster with reason <code class="literal">disconnected</code> when they shut
down, but if they rejoin the cluster without restarting then there is some
other problem.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch is designed to run on a fairly reliable network. It opens a number of TCP
connections between nodes and expects these connections to remain open forever.
If a connection is closed then Elasticsearch will try and reconnect, so the occasional
blip should have limited impact on the cluster even if the affected node
briefly leaves the cluster. In contrast, repeatedly-dropped connections will
severely affect its operation.</p>
<p>The connections from the elected master node to every other node in the cluster
are particularly important. The elected master never spontaneously closes its
outbound connections to other nodes. Similarly, once a connection is fully
established, a node never spontaneously close its inbound connections unless
the node is shutting down.</p>
<p>If you see a node unexpectedly leave the cluster with the <code class="literal">disconnected</code>
reason, something other than Elasticsearch likely caused the connection to close. A
common cause is a misconfigured firewall with an improper timeout or another
policy that&#8217;s <a class="xref" href="modules-network.html#long-lived-connections" title="Long-lived idle connections">incompatible with Elasticsearch</a>. It could also
be caused by general connectivity issues, such as packet loss due to faulty
hardware or network congestion. If you&#8217;re an advanced user, you can get more
detailed information about network exceptions by configuring the following
loggers:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">logger.org.elasticsearch.transport.TcpTransport: DEBUG
logger.org.elasticsearch.xpack.core.security.transport.netty4.SecurityNetty4Transport: DEBUG</pre>
</div>
<p>In extreme cases, you may need to take packet captures using <code class="literal">tcpdump</code> to
determine whether messages between nodes are being dropped or rejected by some
other device on the network.</p>
<h3><a id="_diagnosing_lagging_nodes_2"></a>Diagnosing <code class="literal">lagging</code> nodes<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/modules/discovery/fault-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elasticsearch needs every node to process cluster state updates reasonably quickly. If a
node takes too long to process a cluster state update, it can be harmful to the
cluster. The master will remove these nodes with the <code class="literal">lagging</code> reason. Refer to
<a class="xref" href="modules-discovery-settings.html" title="Discovery and cluster formation settings">Discovery and cluster formation settings</a> for information about the settings which control
this mechanism.</p>
<p>Lagging is typically caused by performance issues on the removed node. However,
a node may also lag due to severe network delays. To rule out network delays,
ensure that <code class="literal">net.ipv4.tcp_retries2</code> is <a class="xref" href="system-config-tcpretries.html" title="TCP retransmission timeout">configured
properly</a>. Log messages that contain <code class="literal">warn threshold</code> may provide more
information about the root cause.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an advanced user, you can get more detailed information about what
the node was doing when it was removed by configuring the following logger:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">logger.org.elasticsearch.cluster.coordination.LagDetector: DEBUG</pre>
</div>
<p>When this logger is enabled, Elasticsearch will attempt to run the
<a class="xref" href="cluster-nodes-hot-threads.html" title="Nodes hot threads API">Nodes hot threads</a> API on the faulty node and report the results in
the logs on the elected master. The results are compressed, encoded, and split
into chunks to avoid truncation:</p>

<h3><a id="_diagnosing_follower_check_retry_count_exceeded_nodes_2"></a>Diagnosing <code class="literal">follower check retry count exceeded</code> nodes<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/main/docs/reference/modules/discovery/fault-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Nodes sometimes leave the cluster with reason <code class="literal">follower check retry count
exceeded</code> when they shut down, but if they rejoin the cluster without
restarting then there is some other problem.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch needs every node to respond to network messages successfully and
reasonably quickly. If a node rejects requests or does not respond at all then
it can be harmful to the cluster. If enough consecutive checks fail then the
master will remove the node with reason <code class="literal">follower check retry count exceeded</code>
and will indicate in the <code class="literal">node-left</code> message how many of the consecutive
unsuccessful checks failed and how many of them timed out. Refer to
<a class="xref" href="modules-discovery-settings.html" title="Discovery and cluster formation settings">Discovery and cluster formation settings</a> for information about the settings which control
this mechanism.</p>
<p>Timeouts and failures may be due to network delays or performance problems on
the affected nodes. Ensure that <code class="literal">net.ipv4.tcp_retries2</code> is
<a class="xref" href="system-config-tcpretries.html" title="TCP retransmission timeout">configured properly</a> to eliminate network delays as
a possible cause for this kind of instability. Log messages containing
<code class="literal">warn threshold</code> may give further clues about the cause of the instability.</p>
<p>If the last check failed with an exception then the exception is reported, and
typically indicates the problem that needs to be addressed. If any of the
checks timed out then narrow down the problem as follows.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
GC pauses are recorded in the GC logs that Elasticsearch emits by default, and also
usually by the <code class="literal">JvmMonitorService</code> in the main node logs. Use these logs to
confirm whether or not the node is experiencing high heap usage with long GC
pauses. If so, <a class="xref" href="high-jvm-memory-pressure.html" title="High JVM memory pressure">the troubleshooting guide for high
heap usage</a> has some suggestions for further investigation but typically you
will need to capture a heap dump and the <a class="xref" href="important-settings.html#gc-logging" title="GC logging settings">garbage collector logs</a>
during a time of high heap usage to fully understand the problem.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
VM pauses also affect other processes on the same host. A VM pause also
typically causes a discontinuity in the system clock, which Elasticsearch will report in
its logs. If you see evidence of other processes pausing at the same time, or
unexpected clock discontinuities, investigate the infrastructure on which you
are running Elasticsearch.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Packet captures will reveal system-level and network-level faults, especially
if you capture the network traffic simultaneously at the elected master and the
faulty node. The connection used for follower checks is not used for any other
traffic so it can be easily identified from the flow pattern alone, even if TLS
is in use: almost exactly every second there will be a few hundred bytes sent
each way, first the request by the master and then the response by the
follower. You should be able to observe any retransmissions, packet loss, or
other delays on such a connection.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Long waits for particular threads to be available can be identified by taking
stack dumps of the main Elasticsearch process (for example, using <code class="literal">jstack</code>) or a
profiling trace (for example, using Java Flight Recorder) in the few seconds
leading up to the relevant log message.</p>
<p>The <a class="xref" href="cluster-nodes-hot-threads.html" title="Nodes hot threads API">Nodes hot threads</a> API sometimes yields useful information, but
bear in mind that this API also requires a number of <code class="literal">transport_worker</code> and
<code class="literal">generic</code> threads across all the nodes in the cluster. The API may be affected
by the very problem you&#8217;re trying to diagnose. <code class="literal">jstack</code> is much more reliable
since it doesn&#8217;t require any JVM threads.</p>
<p>The threads involved in discovery and cluster membership are mainly
<code class="literal">transport_worker</code> and <code class="literal">cluster_coordination</code> threads, for which there should
never be a long wait. There may also be evidence of long waits for threads in
the Elasticsearch logs, particularly looking at warning logs from
<code class="literal">org.elasticsearch.transport.InboundHandler</code>. See
<a class="xref" href="modules-network.html#modules-network-threading-model" title="Networking threading model">Networking threading model</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>By default the follower checks will time out after 30s, so if node departures
are unpredictable then capture stack dumps every 15s to be sure that at least
one stack dump was taken at the right time.</p>

<p>If a node leaves and rejoins the cluster then Elasticsearch will usually shut down and
re-initialize its shards. If the shards do not shut down quickly enough then
Elasticsearch may fail to re-initialize them due to a <code class="literal">ShardLockObtainFailedException</code>.</p>
<p>To gather more information about the reason for shards shutting down slowly,
configure the following logger:</p>
