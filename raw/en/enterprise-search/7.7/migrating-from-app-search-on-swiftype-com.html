<p>App Search is available on Elastic Cloud as Enterprise Search, which combines App Search and Workplace Search into a single solution (<a href="/blog/elastic-enterprise-search-now-available-on-elastic-cloud" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the Elastic Cloud announcement</a>).</p>
<p>This document explains how to migrate your engines from App Search on Swiftype.com to Enterprise Search on Elastic Cloud.</p>

<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>API Endpoints and Keys need to be updated</strong></span> - your new engines will have new API tokens and endpoints which will need to be updated in all clients.

<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Disk Space</strong></span> – when provisioning Enterprise Search for Elastic Cloud, you&#8217;ll need Enterprise Search (App Search) as well as Elasticsearch nodes to store everything, including your documents, logs, and analytics. You&#8217;ll spin up those Elasticsearch nodes with your Enterprise Search deployment. Migrations with less than 100,000 documents should be handled well by the default deployment in Elastic Cloud. If you&#8217;re dealing with more than 100,000 documents, you may want to consider increasing your storage. Additionally, if you have analytics or log retention requirements, you&#8217;ll need to account for those when provisioning storage.

<p>Provisioning an Enterprise Search deployment on Elastic Cloud requires manual resource management. Notably:</p>
