<p>From 7.7.0 onwards, App Search is distributed as Elastic Enterprise Search, a solution which
combines Elastic App Search and Elastic Workplace Search into a single package
(<a href="/blog/elastic-enterprise-search-now-available-on-elastic-cloud" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the Elastic Cloud announcement</a>).
That transition means there is no direct upgrade path from App Search 7.6 to 7.7.
Rather, App Search 7.6 users must migrate to Enterprise Search.
The following document outlines the migration process.</p>
<p>As of 7.9.2, there is a known issue with the migration process, outlined below. Before going through the upgrade process, we recommend you familiarize yourself with the issue outlined below to see if it may apply to your deployment.</p>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Always make sure you have the latest backups for your original App Search deployment and do not
switch production traffic to Enterprise Search until you have fully vetted its functionality.</p>

<p>There is an assistant to help you migrate your App Search deployment to Enterprise Search, available when you click on "Upgrade" in your Deployments page. A step-by-step guide to migrating is available:</p>

<p>As of 7.9.2, there is a known issue around the migration process:</p>

<p>Currently, if you create an Enterprise Search deployment from an App Search snapshot or attempt a
migration using the provided Elastic Cloud upgrade process, the new deployment may fail to start
Enterprise Search instances.</p>
<p>It is a known issue related to the snapshot recovery process on very large deployments and the fact
that analytics indexes in App Search are recovered from the snapshot long before system indexes.
To help alleviate the issue, you can prepare your App Search deployment for a migration by changing
index recovery priorities on your App Search deployment to make sure system indexes are recovered
from snapshots before analytics and API logs.</p>
<p>This can be done by running the following Elasticsearch API command on your App Search deployment:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-javascript">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-javascript">PUT .app-search-*,-.app-search-*-logs-*/_settings
{
  "settings": {
    "index.priority": 101
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>After you perform this command, you will need to take a fresh snapshot before running the upgrade process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you still experience the issue, you have a few options:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Re-apply the deployment plan on your new Enterprise Search cluster by clicking "Edit" within
Elastic Cloud view of your deployment and then "Save" without making any changes. This will retry
the Enterprise Search instance provisioning process and should get your deployment into a healthy
state.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Revert to your existing App Search deployment and contact support to assist you with the migration process.
</li>
</ol>

your original App Search deployment.</p>
