<p>This document describes the breaking changes in Enterprise Search 8.0.0 and provides additional information to help operators upgrade from Enterprise Search 7.x to Enterprise Search 8.x.</p>

<h4><a id="upgrading-from-7-x-7-17"></a>Upgrading to 7.17 is a prerequisite<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.15/enterprise-search-docs/upgrading-from-7-x.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Before upgrading to Enterprise Search 8.0.0 or greater, you must upgrade to Enterprise Search 7.17.x.</p>
<p>For example, if upgrading from Enterprise Search 7.14.1 to Enterprise Search 8.0.0, you must perform two upgrades:</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>7.14.1
&#8594;
7.17.0
&#8594;
8.0.0</strong></span></p>
<p>When upgrading Enterprise Search, you must also upgrade Elasticsearch and Kibana.
These services must use matching minor versions.</p>
<h4><a id="upgrading-from-7-x-security"></a>Security for the Elastic Stack is required<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.15/enterprise-search-docs/upgrading-from-7-x.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Before 8.0.0, it was possible to run Enterprise Search without first enabling security for the Elastic Stack.
Since 8.0.0, Enterprise Search requires Elastic Stack security to be enabled.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Security for the Elastic Stack is always enabled on Elastic Cloud.
This information applies to self-managed deployments only.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Since 8.0.0, Elastic security features are enabled by default.
For details, see <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/configuring-stack-security.html" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Start the Elastic Stack with security enabled</a>.</p>
<p>Enterprise Search will not start if you disable security.</p>
<h4><a id="upgrading-from-7-x-standalone-ui"></a>The standalone Enterprise Search management interface is removed<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.15/enterprise-search-docs/upgrading-from-7-x.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Enterprise Search 8.0.0 removes the standalone management interface for Enterprise Search.</p>
<p>Manage Enterprise Search from <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.15/index.html" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kibana</a>, the standard management interface for Elastic.
To set up Kibana, see <a class="xref" href="installation.html" title="Run Enterprise Search server using downloads (packages)"><em>Run using downloads (packages)</em></a> or <a class="xref" href="docker.html" title="Run Enterprise Search server using Docker images"><em>Run using Docker images</em></a>.</p>
<p>This change also affects the following <a class="xref" href="configuration.html" title="Configuration">configuration</a> settings:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The <code class="literal">ent_search.auth.*</code> settings have been removed, since they are specific to the standalone management interface.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The <code class="literal">kibana.host</code> setting is now required.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Finally, if you have used the standalone management interface to connect Workplace Search content sources, you will need to update the client applications you have registered with 3rd party content services.
See <a class="xref" href="upgrading-from-7-x.html#upgrading-from-7-x-workplace-search-content-sources" title="Update redirect URIs for Workplace Search content sources">Update redirect URIs for Workplace Search content sources</a>.</p>
<h5><a id="upgrading-from-7-x-workplace-search-content-sources"></a>Update redirect URIs for Workplace Search content sources<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.15/enterprise-search-docs/upgrading-from-7-x.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>Workplace Search connects your Elastic deployment to various content services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive.
Before you can initially connect to each service, you must register Workplace Search as a client of that service.</p>
<p>If you previously completed this process using the Workplace Search standalone management interface, you must update the OAuth applications you have registered with each 3rd party service.
You must provide an updated redirect URI to ensure each service redirects to Kibana rather than to the standalone management interface (which was removed in 8.0).</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t apply these changes, your existing connections will likely continue to sync.
However, at some point a connector may fail to refresh its OAuth token and will need you to reauthorize the application.
In this case, the "reauthorize" button in Kibana will not work, since you will not be redirected back to Kibana after authenticating to the 3rd party service.</p>
<p>Use the following sections to update or replace each OAuth app.
For each app, try to update the existing app.
If you cannot, replace the app.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Update an existing OAuth application:</strong></span></p>

<h4><a id="upgrade-from-7-x-workplace-search-api-keys"></a>Workplace Search API keys replace admin access tokens<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.15/enterprise-search-docs/upgrading-from-7-x.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Enterprise Search 8.0 removes Workplace Search admin access tokens and adds <a href="/guide/en/workplace-search/8.15/workplace-search-api-authentication.html#auth-token" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workplace Search API keys</a>.</p>
<p>When upgrading to Enterprise Search 8.0, existing admin access tokens are migrated to API keys.
(Specifically, tokens with write access that are associated with an admin user are migrated.)
Therefore, migrated admin access tokens will continue to work as API keys.</p>
<p>However, the behavior of API keys differs from admin access tokens.
Each admin access token was associated with a specific user.
When requesting documents using an admin access token, <a href="/guide/en/workplace-search/8.15/workplace-search-sources-document-permissions.html" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document-level permissions</a> were applied, limiting the response to only the documents the user could access.
When requesting documents using a Workplace Search API key, document-level permissions are <em>not</em> applied.
Requests using a Workplace Search API key can access all documents for a content source.</p>
<p>Also, Workplace Search API keys can be used with <a href="/guide/en/workplace-search/8.15/workplace-search-content-sources.html#organizational-vs-private" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organization content sources</a> only.
They cannot be used with private content sources.</p>
<p>Workplace Search API keys are useful for integrators who are building their own connectors using custom sources.
For example, an integrator can use a Workplace Search API key to list all documents for a content source to determine which documents to delete.</p>
<p>Workplace Search admin users can list, create, and delete Workplace Search API keys within Kibana.
See <a href="/guide/en/workplace-search/8.15/workplace-search-api-authentication.html#auth-token" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workplace Search API keys</a>.</p>
