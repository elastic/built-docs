<p>As we continue to evolve and improve Elasticsearch, it&#8217;s essential to stay informed about upcoming changes, migrations, and tools that will help us navigate this transition. Below is a list of key resources and initiatives related to App Search migrations, future enhancements, and decommissioning.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="upgrading-to-9-x-app-search-migration"></a>Migrating from App Search</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.18/enterprise-search-docs/upgrading-to-9-x.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>As App Search will not be available in 9.0 and beyond, we&#8217;ve put together a <a href="/blog/app-search-to-elasticsearch" class="ulink" target="_top">blog post of Elasticsearch features</a> that you can use. We also created a comparison of App Search and Elasticsearch features in a <a href="/guide/en/app-search/current/index.html" class="ulink" target="_top">single handy table</a>, so you can know what to expect.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h5><a id="upgrading-to-9-x-app-search-migration-to-elasticsearch"></a>Beyond App Search: Migrating to Elasticsearch</h5><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.18/enterprise-search-docs/upgrading-to-9-x.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>In our blog post <a href="/blog/app-search-to-elasticsearch" class="ulink" target="_top">From App Search to Elasticsearch - Tap into the future of search</a>, we outline the benefits of migrating to Elasticsearch including scalability, flexibility, and improved performance.  To successfully migrate, developers should start by testing and validating Elasticsearch with a small dataset or single index, using the Elasticsearch API to simplify data transformation, indexing, and query execution.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h5><a id="upgrading-to-9-x-app-search-migration-notebook"></a>App Search Migration Notebook</h5><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.18/enterprise-search-docs/upgrading-to-9-x.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>To help with migrating your data to Elasticsearch, we&#8217;ve created an executable <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs/blob/main/notebooks/enterprise-search/app-search-engine-exporter.ipynb" class="ulink" target="_top">App Search migration notebook</a> as a guide. The notebook includes step-by-step instructions, migration scripts, and best practices to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
<p>The notebook includes a description of what takes place under the hood when App Search creates a query to Elasticsearch. You&#8217;ll find examples of how to filter data during export, including filtering by a specific field value, date range, or multiple conditions. The notebook also includes an example of how to improve your search results by adding semantic search, a powerful Elasticsearch capability which is unavailable in App Search.</p>
<p>Additionally, to help with migrating any App Search Web Crawlers you have to Open Crawler, we&#8217;ve created an executable <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs/blob/main/notebooks/enterprise-search/app-search-crawler-to-open-crawler-migration.ipynb" class="ulink" target="_top">App Search Crawler to Open Crawler Notebook</a> that can convert your App Search Web Crawler configurations into Open Crawler-compliant YAML files.

<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="upgrading-to-9-x-workplace-search-migration"></a>Migrating from Workplace Search</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.18/enterprise-search-docs/upgrading-to-9-x.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>For users of Workplace Search, we suggest reading the <a href="/blog/evolution-workplace-search-private-data-elasticsearch" class="ulink" target="_top">Evolution of Workplace Search: From private data to Elasticsearch</a> blog post to learn more about the transition from Workplace Search to Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>Using Elasticsearch directly gives you access to all the most up-to-date and advanced capabilities developed by Elastic, including AI-powered search. In addition to enabling more customized querying and filtering capabilities, you&#8217;ll be able to directly benefit from Elasticsearch&#8217;s scalability and performance.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="upgrading-to-9-x-elastic-web-crawler-open-crawler"></a>Migrating from Elastic Web Crawler to Open Crawler</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.18/enterprise-search-docs/upgrading-to-9-x.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Because Elastic Web Crawler will no longer be available in 9.0 and beyond, we have created an <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs/blob/main/notebooks/enterprise-search/elastic-crawler-to-open-crawler-migration.ipynb" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Crawler to Open Crawler Notebook</a> that can convert your Elastic Web Crawler configurations into Open Crawler-compliant YAML files.

<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="upgrading-to-9-x-elastic-managed-connectors-migration"></a>Migrating Elastic Managed Connectors</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.18/enterprise-search-docs/upgrading-to-9-x.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Elastic managed connectors are not supported in 9.0 and beyond. Before upgrading, you must convert all existing managed connectors to self-managed connectors.</p>
<p>We recommend using the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.18/upgrade-assistant.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana Upgrade Assistant</a> to automatically identify and convert Elastic managed connectors. This lossless process preserves all configurations, schedules, and sync histories.
Find the Upgrade Assistant in the Kibana UI using the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.18/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search" class="ulink" target="_top">global search bar</a>.</p>
<p>You can also manually convert connectors through the Connector UI by clicking "Self-manage this connector" in the connector configuration page.</p>
<p>After conversion, deploy these connectors on your own infrastructure. For detailed instructions, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.18/es-build-connector.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Self-managed connectors documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Elastic Cloud customers will be unable to upgrade until the Kibana Upgrade Assistant can confirm that all your connectors have been converted to self-managed.</p>
<p>Customers using ECK or other self-managed Elastic stacks are strongly encouraged to resolve all Kibana Upgrade Assistant warnings before upgrading, or risk the stability of their upgraded deployment.</p>
