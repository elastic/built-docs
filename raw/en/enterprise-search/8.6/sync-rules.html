<p>Use connector sync rules to help control which documents are synced between the third-party data source and Elasticsearch.
Define sync rules in the Kibana UI for each connector index, under the <code class="literal">Sync rules</code> tab for the index.</p>
<p>Sync rules apply to <a class="xref" href="native-connectors.html" title="Native connectors">native connectors</a> and <a class="xref" href="build-connector.html" title="Connector clients and frameworks">connector clients</a>.
Sync rules do not apply to <a class="xref" href="workplace-search-connectors.html" title="Workplace Search connectors">Workplace Search connectors</a>, although similar features are available in Workplace Search.
See the <a href="/guide/en/workplace-search/8.6" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workplace Search documentation</a>.</p>
<p>There are two types of sync rules:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Basic rules</strong></span> - these rules are represented in a table-like view.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Advanced rules</strong></span> - these rules cover complex query-and-filter scenarios that cannot be expressed with basic rules.
Advanced rules are defined through a source-specific DSL JSON snippet.
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is difficult to discuss sync rules without first level-setting the concepts of data filtering in general.</p>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/filtering-general-diagram.png" alt="Filtering">
</div>
</div>
<p>This diagram is helpful for illustrating that data filtering can occur in several different processes/locations.
First, data might be filtered at its source.
We call this "remote filtering", as the process limiting the data runs external to Elastic.
Next, we have the bucket of "integration filtering".
This covers data filtering that occurs in the process that acts as a bridge between the data&#8217;s source and Elasticsearch (its final destination).
Filtering that takes place in the Enterprise Search connectors is an example of "integration filtering".
Finally, Elasticsearch itself provides the capability for filtering data right before persistence via its <a class="xref" href="ingest-pipelines.html" title="Ingest pipelines">ingest pipelines</a>.</p>
<p>This guide will not focus much on ingest pipeline filtering. However, sync rules can be used to influence both remote and integration filtering.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>At this time, basic sync rules are the only way to control integration filtering for connectors.
However, remote filtering covers a far broader topic than connectors alone could influence.
For best results, work closely with the owners and maintainers of your data source to ensure that your source data is well organized and the source is optimized for the types of queries the connectors will issue to it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="sync-rules-overview"></a>Sync rules overview</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.6/enterprise-search-docs/sync-rules.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Often times, your data lake has far more data than you want exposed to the end user.
For example, you may want to search a product catalog, but not include vendor contact information, even if the two are co-located for business purposes.</p>
<p>The optimal time to filter data is early in the data pipeline, for two reasons:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Performance</strong></span>:
It&#8217;s more efficient to send a query to the backing data source than to obtain all the data and then filter it in the connector.
It&#8217;s faster to send a smaller dataset over a network and to process it on the connector side.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Security</strong></span>:
The query-time filtering is applied on the data source side, so the data is not sent over the network and into the connector, which can limit the exposure of your data.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In a perfect world, all filtering would be done as remote filtering.</p>
<p>In practice, however, this is not always possible.
Some sources do not allow robust remote filtering.
Others do, but require special setup (building indexes on specific fields, tweaking settings) that may require attention from other members of your business.</p>
<p>With this in mind, sync rules were designed to influence both remote filtering and integration filtering.
Your goal should be to do as much remote filtering as possible, but integration is a perfectly viable fall-back.
By definition, the remote filtering is applied before the data is obtained from a third-party source.
Integration filtering is applied after the data is obtained from a third-party source, but before it is ingested into the elasticsearch index.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>All sync rules occur on a given document <em>before</em> any <a class="xref" href="ingest-pipelines.html" title="Ingest pipelines">ingest pipelines</a> are run on that same document.
Therefore, you could use your ingest pipelines for any processing that must occur <em>after</em> integration filtering has occurred.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="sync-rules-basic"></a>Basic rules</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.6/enterprise-search-docs/sync-rules.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Each basic rule can be one of two "policies": <code class="literal">include</code> and <code class="literal">exclude</code>.
<code class="literal">Include</code> rules are used to include the documents that "match" the specified condition.
<code class="literal">Exclude</code> rules are used to exclude the documents that "match" the specified condition.</p>
<p>A "match" is determined based on a condition defined by a combination of "field", "rule", and "value".</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">Field</code> column should be used to define which field on a given document should be considered.</p>
<p>The following rules are available in the <code class="literal">Rule</code> column:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">equals</code> - The field value is equal to the specified value.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">starts_with</code> - The field value starts with the specified (string) value.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">ends_with</code> - The field value ends with the specified (string) value.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">contains</code> - The field value includes the specified (string) value.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">regex</code> - The field value matches the specified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regular expression</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">&gt;</code> - The field value is greater than the specified value.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">&lt;</code> - The field value is less than the specified value.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Finally, the <code class="literal">Value</code> column is dependent on:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
the data type in the specified "field"
</li>
<li class="listitem">
which "rule" was selected.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For example, if a value of <code class="literal">[A-Z]{2}</code> might make sense for a <code class="literal">regex</code> rule, but much less so for a <code class="literal">&gt;</code> rule.
Similarly, you probably wouldn&#8217;t have a value of <code class="literal">espresso</code> when operating on an <code class="literal">ip_address</code> field, but perhaps you would for a <code class="literal">beverage</code> field.</p>

<p>Because remote filtering happens at data source query time, it is highly specific to the datasource.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If the connector cannot determine how to combine one or more basic rules into a single query to the data source, the unused basic rules will not be used remote filtering, but will <em>instead be applied in integration filtering</em>.
If you observe this happening and want to tune performance, consider using the advanced rules to fine-tune your remote filtering.</p>

<p>Advanced rules are only used in remote filtering.
You can think of advanced rules as a language-agnostic way to represent queries to the data source.
Therefore, these rules are highly source-specific.</p>
<p>Each connector supporting advanced rules provides its own DSL to specify rules.

<p>You can also use basic rules and advanced rules together for filtering a data set.</p>
<p>The following diagram provides an overview of the order in which advanced rules, basic rules, and pipeline filtering, are applied to your documents:</p>

<p>In the following example we want to filter a data set containing apartments to only contain apartments with specific properties.
We&#8217;ll use basic and advanced rules throughout the example.</p>
<p>A sample apartment looks like this in the <code class="literal">.json</code> format:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-json">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-json">    {
        "id": 1234,
        "bedrooms": 3,
        "price": 1500,
        "address": {
            "street": "Street 123",
            "government_area": "Area",
            "country_information": {
                "country_code": "PT",
                "country": "Portugal"
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>The target data set should fulfill the following conditions:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Every apartment should have at least three bedrooms
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The apartments should not be more expensive than 1000/month
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The apartment with id <em>1234</em> should get included without considering the first two conditions
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Each apartment should be located either <em>Portugal</em> or <em>Spain</em>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="position-relative"><h5><a id="example-interplay-basic-rules"></a>Basic rules</h5><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.6/enterprise-search-docs/sync-rules.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>To create a new basic rule navigate to the <em>Sync Rules</em> tab and select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Draft new sync rules</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/sync-rules-draft-new-rules.png" alt="Draft new rules">
</div>
</div>
<p>Afterwards you need to press the <em>Save and validate draft</em> button to validate these rules.
Note that when saved the rules will be in <em>draft</em> state. They won&#8217;t be executed in the next sync unless they are <em>applied</em>.</p>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/sync-rules-save-and-validate-draft.png" alt="Save and validate draft">
</div>
</div>
<p>After a successful validation you can apply your rules so they&#8217;ll be executed in the next sync.</p>
<p>These following conditions can be covered by basic rules:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">

<p>Remember that order matters for basic rules.

<p>The last rule can be implemented by leveraging advanced rules.</p>
<p>You want to only include apartments, which are located in "Portugal" or "Spain".
We need to use advanced rules here because we&#8217;re dealing with deeply nested objects.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that the apartment data is stored inside a MongoDB instance.
For MongoDB we support <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/" class="ulink" target="_top">aggregation pipelines</a> in our advanced rules among other things.
An aggregation pipeline to only select those properties, which are located in Portugal or Spain would look like this:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-json">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-json">    [
      {
        "$match": {
             "$or": [
                    {
                      "address.country_information.country": "Portugal"
                    },
                    {
                      "address.country_information.country": "Spain"
                    }
                  ]
                }
      }
    ]</pre>
</div>
<p>To create these advanced rules you navigate again to the sync rules creation dialog and select the <em>Advanced rules</em> tab.
You can now paste your aggregation pipeline into the input field under <code class="literal">aggregate.pipeline</code>:</p>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/sync-rules-paste-aggregation-pipeline.png" alt="Paste aggregation pipeline">
</div>
</div>
<p>After a successful validation you can apply them again like you already for the basic rules.
This view shows you the applied sync rules, which will be executed in the next sync:</p>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
