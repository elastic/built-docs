<p>From 7.7.0 onwards, App Search is distributed as Elastic Enterprise Search, a solution which
combines Elastic App Search and Elastic Workplace Search into a single package
(<a href="/blog/elastic-enterprise-search-now-available-on-elastic-cloud" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the Elastic Cloud announcement</a>).
That transition means there is no direct upgrade path from App Search 7.6 to 7.7.
Rather, App Search 7.6 users must migrate to Enterprise Search.
The following document outlines the migration process.</p>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Before attempting a migration, please ensure you are using the latest 7.x version of Enterprise Search.
There are some known issues with migrations to <a class="xref" href="migrating-from-self-managed-app-search.html#app-search-to-ent-search-self-managed-known-issues" title="Known migration issues">versions before 7.9.1</a> and <a class="xref" href="migrating-from-app-search-on-elastic-cloud.html#app-search-to-ent-search-elastic-cloud-known-issues" title="Known migration issues">versions before 7.9.3</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Always make sure you have the latest backups for your original App Search deployment and do not
switch production traffic to Enterprise Search until you have fully vetted its functionality.</p>

<h3><a id="migrating-from-elastic-cloud-app-search-migration-process-overview"></a>Migration process overview<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.9/enterprise-search-docs/migrating-from-app-search-on-elastic-cloud.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>There is an assistant to help you migrate your App Search deployment to Enterprise Search, available when you click on "Upgrade" in your Deployments page. A step-by-step guide to migrating is available:</p>
<p><a href="/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-upgrade-appsearch.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrade App Search to Enterprise Search</a></p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>After you begin the migration, there is no "downgrade" support.
To restore App Search after migrating, you must start with a clean environment: remove all <code class="literal">.ent-search-*</code> and <code class="literal">.app-search-*</code> indices.
Then restore a snapshot from before the migration and re-install App Search.</p>

<p>In versions before 7.9.3, there is a known issue around the migration process:</p>
<h3><a id="migrating-from-app-search-on-elastic-cloud-failing"></a>Failing Migrations on Very Large Deployments<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/8.9/enterprise-search-docs/migrating-from-app-search-on-elastic-cloud.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Fixed in <a href="/guide/en/enterprise-search/7.9/7.9.3-release-notes.html" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.9.3</a>.</p>
<p>In versions before 7.9.3, if you create an Enterprise Search deployment from an App Search snapshot or attempt a
migration using the provided Elastic Cloud upgrade process, the new deployment may fail to start
Enterprise Search instances.</p>
<p>It is a known issue related to the snapshot recovery process on very large deployments and the fact
that analytics indexes in App Search are recovered from the snapshot long before system indexes.
To help alleviate the issue, you can prepare your App Search deployment for a migration by changing
index recovery priorities on your App Search deployment to make sure system indexes are recovered
from snapshots before analytics and API logs.</p>
<p>This can be done by running the following Elasticsearch API command on your App Search deployment:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-javascript">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-javascript">PUT .app-search-*,-.app-search-*-logs-*/_settings
{
  "settings": {
    "index.priority": 101
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>After you perform this command, you will need to take a fresh snapshot before running the upgrade process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you still experience the issue, you have a few options:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Re-apply the deployment plan on your new Enterprise Search cluster by clicking "Edit" within
Elastic Cloud view of your deployment and then "Save" without making any changes. This will retry
the Enterprise Search instance provisioning process and should get your deployment into a healthy
state.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Revert to your existing App Search deployment and contact support to assist you with the migration process.
</li>
</ol>

<div class="admon_content">
<p>Always remember to disable the <a class="xref" href="read-only-mode.html" title="Read-only mode">read-only mode</a> if you are rolling back to
your original App Search deployment.</p>
