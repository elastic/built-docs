<p>Use connector sync rules to help control which documents are synced between the third-party data source and Elasticsearch.
Define sync rules in the Kibana UI for each connector index, under the <code class="literal">Sync rules</code> tab for the index.</p>
<p>Sync rules apply to <a class="xref" href="native-connectors.html" title="Native connectors">native connectors</a> and <a class="xref" href="build-connector.html" title="Connector clients and frameworks">connector clients</a>.</p>

<p>Sync rules are a <span class="strong strong"><strong>beta feature</strong></span>.
Beta features are subject to change and are not covered by the support SLA of general release (GA) features. Elastic plans to promote this feature to GA in a future release.</p>
<p>In Elastic versions <span class="strong strong"><strong>8.8.0 and later</strong></span> all connectors have support for <em>basic</em> sync rules.</p>
<p>Some connectors support <em>advanced</em> sync rules.

<p>There are two types of sync rule:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Basic sync rules</strong></span> - these rules are represented in a table-like view.
Basic sync rules are identical for all connectors.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Advanced sync rules</strong></span> - these rules cover complex query-and-filter scenarios that cannot be expressed with basic sync rules.
Advanced sync rules are defined through a <em>source-specific</em> DSL JSON snippet.

<p>Before discussing sync rules, it&#8217;s important to establish a basic understanding of <em>data filtering</em> concepts.
The following diagram shows that data filtering can occur in several different processes/locations.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/filtering-general-diagram.png" alt="Filtering">
</div>
</div>
<p>In this documentation we will focus on remote and integration filtering.
Sync rules can be used to modify both of these.</p>
<h4><a id="sync-rules-general-filtering-remote"></a>Remote filtering<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/main/enterprise-search-docs/sync-rules.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Data might be filtered at its source.
We call this <span class="strong strong"><strong>remote filtering</strong></span>, as the filtering process is external to Elastic.</p>
<h4><a id="sync-rules-general-filtering-integration"></a>Integration filtering<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/main/enterprise-search-docs/sync-rules.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Integration filtering</strong></span> acts as a bridge between the original data source and Elasticsearch.
Filtering that takes place in the Enterprise Search connectors is an example of integration filtering.</p>
<h4><a id="sync-rules-general-filtering-pipeline"></a>Pipeline filtering<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/main/enterprise-search-docs/sync-rules.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Finally, Elasticsearch can filter data right <em>before persistence</em> using <a class="xref" href="ingest-pipelines.html" title="Ingest pipelines">ingest pipelines</a>.
We will not focus on ingest pipeline filtering in this guide.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Currently, basic sync rules are the only way to control <em>integration filtering</em> for connectors.
Remember that remote filtering extends far beyond the scope of connectors alone.
For best results, collaborate with the owners and maintainers of your data source.
Ensure the source data is well-organized and optimized for the query types made by the connectors.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><a id="sync-rules-overview"></a>Sync rules overview<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/main/enterprise-search-docs/sync-rules.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, your data lake will contain far more data than you want to expose to end users.
For example, you may want to search a product catalog, but not include vendor contact information, even if the two are co-located for business purposes.</p>
<p>The optimal time to filter data is <em>early</em> in the data pipeline.
There are two main reasons:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Performance</strong></span>:
It&#8217;s more efficient to send a query to the backing data source than to obtain all the data and then filter it in the connector.
It&#8217;s faster to send a smaller dataset over a network and to process it on the connector side.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Security</strong></span>:
Query-time filtering is applied on the data source side, so the data is not sent over the network and into the connector, which limits the exposure of your data.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In a perfect world, all filtering would be done as remote filtering.</p>
<p>In practice, however, this is not always possible.
Some sources do not allow robust remote filtering.
Others do, but require special setup (building indexes on specific fields, tweaking settings, etc.) that may require attention from other stakeholders in your organization.</p>
<p>With this in mind, sync rules were designed to modify both remote filtering and integration filtering.
Your goal should be to do as much remote filtering as possible, but integration is a perfectly viable fall-back.
By definition, remote filtering is applied before the data is obtained from a third-party source.
Integration filtering is applied after the data is obtained from a third-party source, but before it is ingested into the Elasticsearch index.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>All sync rules are applied to a given document <em>before</em> any <a class="xref" href="ingest-pipelines.html" title="Ingest pipelines">ingest pipelines</a> are run on that document.
Therefore, you can use ingest pipelines for any processing that must occur <em>after</em> integration filtering has occurred.</p>

<h3><a id="sync-rules-basic"></a>Basic sync rules<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/main/enterprise-search-docs/sync-rules.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Each basic sync rules can be one of two "policies": <code class="literal">include</code> and <code class="literal">exclude</code>.
<code class="literal">Include</code> rules are used to include the documents that "match" the specified condition.
<code class="literal">Exclude</code> rules are used to exclude the documents that "match" the specified condition.</p>
<p>A "match" is determined based on a condition defined by a combination of "field", "rule", and "value".</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">Field</code> column should be used to define which field on a given document should be considered.</p>
<p>The following rules are available in the <code class="literal">Rule</code> column:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">equals</code> - The field value is equal to the specified value.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">starts_with</code> - The field value starts with the specified (string) value.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">ends_with</code> - The field value ends with the specified (string) value.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">contains</code> - The field value includes the specified (string) value.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">regex</code> - The field value matches the specified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regular expression</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">&gt;</code> - The field value is greater than the specified value.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">&lt;</code> - The field value is less than the specified value.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Finally, the <code class="literal">Value</code> column is dependent on:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
the data type in the specified "field"
</li>
<li class="listitem">
which "rule" was selected.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For example, if a value of <code class="literal">[A-Z]{2}</code> might make sense for a <code class="literal">regex</code> rule, but much less so for a <code class="literal">&gt;</code> rule.
Similarly, you probably wouldn&#8217;t have a value of <code class="literal">espresso</code> when operating on an <code class="literal">ip_address</code> field, but perhaps you would for a <code class="literal">beverage</code> field.</p>

<p>Advanced sync rules overwrite any remote filtering query that could have been inferred from the basic sync rules.

<p>Advanced sync rules are only used in remote filtering.
You can think of advanced sync rules as a language-agnostic way to represent queries to the data source.
Therefore, these rules are highly <span class="strong strong"><strong>source-specific</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Each connector supporting advanced sync rules provides its own DSL to specify rules.

<p>You can also use basic sync rules and advanced sync rules together to filter a data set.</p>
<p>The following diagram provides an overview of the order in which advanced sync rules, basic sync rules, and pipeline filtering, are applied to your documents:</p>

<p>In the following example we want to filter a data set containing apartments to only contain apartments with specific properties.
We&#8217;ll use basic and advanced sync rules throughout the example.</p>
<p>A sample apartment looks like this in the <code class="literal">.json</code> format:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-json">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-json">    {
        "id": 1234,
        "bedrooms": 3,
        "price": 1500,
        "address": {
            "street": "Street 123",
            "government_area": "Area",
            "country_information": {
                "country_code": "PT",
                "country": "Portugal"
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>The target data set should fulfill the following conditions:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Every apartment should have at least <span class="strong strong"><strong>3 bedrooms</strong></span>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The apartments should not be more expensive than <span class="strong strong"><strong>1500 per month</strong></span>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The apartment with id <em>1234</em> should get included without considering the first two conditions
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Each apartment should be located in either <em>Portugal</em> or <em>Spain</em>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The first 3 conditions can be handled by basic sync rules, but we&#8217;ll need to use advanced sync rules for number 4.</p>

<p>To create a new basic sync rule, navigate to the <em>Sync Rules</em> tab and select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Draft new sync rules</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/sync-rules-draft-new-rules.png" alt="Draft new rules">

</div>
<p>Afterwards you need to press the <em>Save and validate draft</em> button to validate these rules.
Note that when saved the rules will be in <em>draft</em> state. They won&#8217;t be executed in the next sync unless they are <em>applied</em>.</p>

<p>You want to only include apartments which are located in Portugal or Spain.
We need to use advanced sync rules here, because we&#8217;re dealing with deeply nested objects.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that the apartment data is stored inside a MongoDB instance.
For MongoDB we support <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregation pipelines</a> in our advanced sync rules among other things.
An aggregation pipeline to only select properties located in Portugal or Spain looks like this:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-json">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-json">    [
      {
        "$match": {
             "$or": [
                    {
                      "address.country_information.country": "Portugal"
                    },
                    {
                      "address.country_information.country": "Spain"
                    }
                  ]
                }
      }
    ]</pre>
</div>
<p>To create these advanced sync rules navigate to the sync rules creation dialog and select the <em>Advanced rules</em> tab.
You can now paste your aggregation pipeline into the input field under <code class="literal">aggregate.pipeline</code>:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/sync-rules-paste-aggregation-pipeline.png" alt="Paste aggregation pipeline">

<p>Once validated, apply these rules.
The following screenshot shows the applied sync rules, which will be executed in the next sync:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
