<summary class="title"><span class="strong strong"><strong>What is the Elasticsearch Relevance Engine?</strong></span></summary>
<div class="content">
<p>The Elasticsearch Relevance Engine (ESRE) is a collection of tools for developing search applications using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="learn.html" title="What is Elasticsearch Relevance Engine (ESRE)?"><em>Learn</em></a> to learn about each of the components that make up ESRE.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="title"><span class="strong strong"><strong>What can I build with Elasticsearch Relevance Engine?</strong></span></summary>
<div class="content">
<p>Elasticsearch is a leading search technology for websites (think ecommerce product and discovery) and retrieving information within an organization&#8217;s digital environment (think customer success knowledge bases and enterprise search).
ESRE is a toolkit for building AI-powered search experiences.
Your users can express their queries in natural language, in the form of a question or a description of the information they need.
Combine this natural language capability with generative AI to augment models with context from private or proprietary data.</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="example.html" title="ESRE examples"><em>Examples</em></a> for links to example applications and implementations.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="title"><span class="strong strong"><strong>How are Elasticsearch and Elasticsearch Relevance Engine different?</strong></span></summary>
<div class="content">
<p>Elasticsearch Relevance Engine tools are designed to use Elasticsearch as an underlying storage and search technology.
Developers can use Elastic APIs or familiar tools, such as Kibana, to interact with this toolkit.</p>

<summary class="title"><span class="strong strong"><strong>What is Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder?</strong></span></summary>
<div class="content">
<p><a href="/guide/en/machine-learning/8.15/ml-nlp-elser.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder</a> is a model built by Elastic for high relevance semantic search across a variety of domains.
This <em>text expansion model</em> uses a sparse vector representation of text, compared to traditional dense vector representations.
This means you don&#8217;t need to generate embeddings for your data (or queries), and you don&#8217;t need to fine tune the model for your domain.</p>
<p>This model helps capture meaning and intent in natural language queries and, because it doesn&#8217;t need to be fine tuned on your data, it works out of the box.</p>
</div>

<details>
<summary class="title"><span class="strong strong"><strong>What is hybrid search?</strong></span></summary>
<div class="content">
<p>Hybrid search is the combination of vector search and lexical search.
Elasticsearch is the industry leader in lexical search, and we&#8217;ve been investing in vector search capabilities since 2019.
Elastic enables you to combine the best of both worlds.
Use RRF to power your hybrid search strategy with Elastic.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="title"><span class="strong strong"><strong>What is RRF?</strong></span></summary>
<div class="content">
<p><a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/rrf.html#rrf-using-multiple-standard-retrievers" class="ulink" target="_top">Reciprocal Rank Fusion(RRF)</a>is a state-of-the-art rank fusion algorithm for combining rankings from multiple information retrieval systems, without requiring calibration or fine tuning.</p>
<p>With Elastic 8.9.0, you can now implement hybrid search strategies by combining ELSER-powered semantic search with classical lexical search using <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/rrf.html#rrf-using-multiple-standard-retrievers" class="ulink" target="_top">the retrievers option</a>.</p>

<summary class="title"><span class="strong strong"><strong>What is a vector database?</strong></span></summary>
<div class="content">
<p>A vector database consists of two primary components:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Embedding store and index</strong></span>.
Embeddings are the <em>vector</em> representations of your unstructured data (text, images, etc.).
Each data point is represented by an array (or <em>vector</em>) of numbers, plotted (or <em>embedded</em>) in a high-dimensional mathematical space.
In simple terms, embedding means translating your data into floating-point numbers where similar data points are situated closer together.
Different models use different techniques to generate embeddings, but the principle is the same: similar data points are closer together in the vector space.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>A search algorithm</strong></span>.
A vector database uses a search algorithm to find the nearest neighbors to a given query.
When a user sends a query the query text is embedded, using the same algorithm as the training data.
This enables rapid semantic similarity search.
Because the values exist on a continuum, you can find data points that are semantically similar, even if they don&#8217;t share the same keywords.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Note that traditional vector search uses dense vector representations of data, which is a different approach to the Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder model&#8217;s sparse representation.</p>
</div>

<summary class="title"><span class="strong strong"><strong>Is Elasticsearch a vector database?</strong></span></summary>
<div class="content">
<p>Elasticsearch is a vector database and much more!
Unlike pure play vector databases, Elastic combines all the components you need to work with vectors in a single platform:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Embedding store</strong></span>.
Store and index your embeddings in Elasticsearch natively using the <code class="literal">dense_vector</code> field type.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Nearest neighbor search</strong></span>.
Efficiently search for <span class="strong strong"><strong>nearest neighbors</strong></span> to a given query in your dataset using our inference API.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Embedding model</strong></span>.
Generate embeddings for your data within the Elastic platform.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>This approach eliminates the inefficiencies and complexities of making external API calls, a limitation of pure vector databases.</p>

<summary class="title"><span class="strong strong"><strong>What is a transformer, and is Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder a transformer model?</strong></span></summary>
<div class="content">
<p>A transformer is a deep neural network architecture which serves as the basis for LLMs. Transformers consist of various components and can be composed of encoders, decoders, and many "deep" neural network layers with many millions (or even billions) of parameters.</p>
<p>Typically trained on very large corpora of text like data on the Internet, and can be fine-tuned to perform a variety of NLP tasks.
Our new retrieval model uses a transformer architecture but consists of an encoder designed specifically for semantic search across a wide variety of domains.</p>

<summary class="title"><span class="strong strong"><strong>How do I get started with Elasticsearch Relevance Engine? Do I need to purchase Elasticsearch Relevance Engine separately?</strong></span></summary>
<div class="content">
<p>All of Elasticsearch Relevance Engine&#8217;s capabilities come with Elastic Enterprise Search Platinum and Enterprise plans.
