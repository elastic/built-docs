<h3><a id="elastic-agent"></a>Elastic Agent<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/ingest-management/fleet-overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elastic Agent is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and
other types of data to each host. A single agent makes it easier and faster
to deploy monitoring across your infrastructure. The agent&#8217;s single, unified
policy makes it easier to add integrations for new data sources.</p>
<h3><a id="fleet"></a>Fleet<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/ingest-management/fleet-overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Fleet provides a web-based UI in Kibana to add and manage integrations
for popular services and platforms, as well as manage a fleet of Elastic Agents. Our
integrations provide an easy way to add new sources of data, plus they ship
with out-of-the-box assets like dashboards, visualizations, and pipelines to
extract structured fields out of logs. This makes it easier to get insights
within seconds.</p>

<h3><a id="configuring-integrations"></a>Integrations in Fleet<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/ingest-management/fleet-overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Fleet provides a web-based UI for configuring integrations with your
data sources. This includes popular services and platforms like Nginx or AWS,
as well as many generic input types like log files.</p>
<p>The Elastic Agent policy allows you to use any number of integrations for
data sources. You can apply the Elastic Agent policy to multiple agents,
making it even easier to manage configuration at scale.</p>

</div>
<p>When you add an integration, you select the agent policy to use then
configure inputs for logs and metrics, such as the path to your Nginx access
logs. When you&#8217;re done, you save the integration to update the Elastic Agent
policy. The next time enrolled agents check in, they receive the update.
Having the policies automatically deployed is more convenient
than doing it yourself by using SSH, Ansible playbooks, or some other tool.</p>
<p>If you prefer infrastructure as code, you may use YAML files and APIs.
Fleet has an API-first design. Anything you can do in the UI, you
can also do using the API. This makes it easy to automate and integrate with
other systems.</p>

<p>You can see the state of all your Elastic Agents in Fleet. On the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Agents</strong></span> page,
you can see which agents are online, which have errors, and the last time
they checked in. You can also see the version of the Elastic Agent binary and
policy.</p>

<p>Fleet serves as the communication channel back to the Elastic Agents. Agents check
in for the latest updates on a regular basis. You can have any number of agents
enrolled into each agent policy, which allows you to scale up to
thousands of hosts. When you make a change to an agent policy, all the
agents receive the update during their next check-in. You no longer have to
distribute policy updates yourself.</p>
<h4><a id="data-streams"></a>Data streams make index management easier<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/ingest-management/fleet-overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The data collected by Elastic Agent is stored in indices that are more granular than
you’d get by default with Filebeat. This gives you more visibility into the
sources of data volume, and control over lifecycle management policies and index
permissions. These indices are called <em>data streams</em>.</p>
<p>As you can see in the following screen, each data stream (or index) is broken
out by dataset, type, and namespace.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/kibana-fleet-datastreams.png" alt="Data streams page">
</div>
</div>
<p>The <em>dataset</em> is defined by the integration and describes the fields and other
settings for each index. For example, you might have one dataset for process
metrics with a field describing whether the process is running or not, and
another dataset for disk I/O metrics with a field describing the number of bytes
read.</p>
<p>This indexing strategy solves the issue of having indices with hundreds or
thousands of fields. Because each index stores only a small number of fields,
the indices are more compact with faster autocomplete. And as an added
bonus, the Discover page only shows relevant fields.</p>
<p><em>Namespaces</em> are user-defined strings that allow you to group data any way you
like. A namespace can be up to 100 bytes in length (multi-byte characters will
count toward this limit faster). For example, you might group your data by
environment (<code class="literal">prod</code>, <code class="literal">QA</code>) or by team name. Using a namespace makes it easier to
search the data from a given source by using index patterns, or to give users
permissions to data by assigning an index pattern to user roles.</p>
<p>When searching your data in Kibana, you can use an
<a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.10/index-patterns.html" class="ulink" target="_top">index pattern</a> to search across all or some of
the indices.</p>
