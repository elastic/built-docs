<h3><a id="enrolled-agent-not-showing-up"></a>Why doesn&#8217;t my enrolled agent show up in the Fleet app?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If Elastic Agent was successfully enrolled, but doesn&#8217;t show up in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Agents</strong></span> list,
it might not be started. Make sure the <code class="literal">elastic-agent</code> process is running on
the host. If it&#8217;s not running, use the <a class="xref" href="elastic-agent-cmd-options.html#elastic-agent-run-command" title="elastic-agent run"><code class="literal">run</code></a>
command to start it.  The most common way to deploy an Elastic Agent is by using
the <code class="literal">install</code> command. This command starts the Elastic Agent for you.</p>
<h3><a id="where-are-the-agent-logs"></a>Where does Elastic Agent store logs after startup?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The location of Elastic Agent logs varies by platform. In general, Elastic Agent stores
logs under the <code class="literal">data</code> directory where Elastic Agent was started. For example, on
macOS, you&#8217;ll find logs for the running Elastic Agent under path similar to:</p>
<p><code class="literal">/Library/Elastic/Agent/data/elastic-agent-08e204/logs/elastic-agent-json.log</code></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find logs for the Beats shippers, such as Metricbeat, under paths
like:</p>
<p><code class="literal">/Library/Elastic/Agent/data/elastic-agent-08e204/logs/default/metricbeat-json.log</code></p>
<p>If the log path does not exist, Elastic Agent was unable to start Metricbeat, which
is a higher level problem to triage. Usually you can see these logs in the
Fleet UI, unless there are problems severe enough that the Elastic Agent or its
related  processes cannot send data to Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="elastic-agent-installation.html#installation-layout" title="Installation layout">Installation layout</a> to find out the exact paths for each platform.</p>
<h3><a id="what-is-my-agent-config"></a>What policy is the Elastic Agent running?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>To find the policy file, inspect the <code class="literal">elastic-agent.yml</code> file in the
directory where Elastic Agent is running. Not sure where the agent is running? See
<a class="xref" href="elastic-agent-installation.html#installation-layout" title="Installation layout">Installation layout</a>.</p>
<p>If the agent is running in Fleet mode, this file contains the following
citation:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">fleet:
  enabled: true</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code class="literal">state.yml</code> file (located under <code class="literal">data/elastic-agent-*</code>) contains the
entire, unencrypted policy.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>To see the Elasticsearch location, look at the <code class="literal">hosts</code> setting under <code class="literal">outputs</code>. For
example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-json">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-json">outputs:
  default:

    type: elasticsearch</pre>
</div>
<p>This file also shows the version of all packages used by the current
policy.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>To see the Elastic Agent version, run:</p>

<h3><a id="where-is-the-data-agent-is-sending"></a>Why can&#8217;t I see the data Elastic Agent is sending?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If Elastic Agent is set up and running, but you don&#8217;t see data in Kibana:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Go to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Management &gt; Dev Tools</strong></span> in Kibana, and in the Console, search your
index for data. For example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET metrics-*/_search</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/3.console"></div>
<p>Or if you prefer, go to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Discover</strong></span> app.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Look at the data that Elastic Agent has sent and see if the <code class="literal">name.host</code>
field contains your host machine name.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If you don&#8217;t see data for your host, it&#8217;s possible that the data is blocked
in the network, or that a firewall or security problem is preventing the Elastic Agent
from sending the data.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s redundant to install stand-alone Metricbeat, you might want to
try installing it to see if it&#8217;s able to send data successfully to Elasticsearch. For
more information, see
<a href="/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/7.15/metricbeat-installation-configuration.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Metricbeat quick start</a>.</p>
<p>If Metricbeat is able to send data to Elasticsearch, there is possibly a bug or
problem with Elastic Agent, and you should report it.</p>
<h3><a id="i-deleted-my-agent"></a>How do I restore an Elastic Agent that I deleted from Fleet?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s ok, we&#8217;ve got your back! The data is still in Elasticsearch. To add Elastic Agent
to Fleet again, <a class="xref" href="stop-elastic-agent.html" title="Stop Elastic Agent">Stop Elastic Agent</a>, re-enroll it on the host, then
run Elastic Agent.</p>
<h3><a id="i-rebooted-my-host"></a>How do I restart Elastic Agent after rebooting my host?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elastic Agent should restart automatically when you reboot your host. If it doesn&#8217;t,
you can start it manually by running:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">elastic-agent run</pre>
</div>
<p>If the process is already running, you can restart it by running:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">elastic-agent restart</pre>
</div>
<h3><a id="does-agent-download-packages"></a>Does Elastic Agent or Kibana download integration packages?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elastic Agent does not download integration packages. When you add an integration in
Fleet, Kibana connects to the Elastic Package Registry at <code class="literal">epr.elastic.co</code>,
downloads the integration package, and stores its assets in Elasticsearch. This means
that you no longer have to run a manual setup command to load integrations as
you did previously with Beats modules.</p>
<h3><a id="does-agent-download-anything-from-internet"></a>Does Elastic Agent download anything from the Internet?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>As of 7.10 and beyond, the endpoint security capabilities are bundled with Elastic Agent,
so a fully capable artifact can be installed with no connection to the Elastic
download site.  However, if it is in use, the Endpoint Security process
is instructed to attempt to download newer released versions of the integration specific
artifacts it uses.  Some of those are, for example, the malware model, trusted apps artifact,
exceptions list artifact, and others.  For more information, see the
<a href="/guide/en/security/7.15/index.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Security solution documentation</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="do-i-need-to-setup-elastic-agent"></a>Do I need to set up the Beats managed by Elastic Agent?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You might have noticed that Elastic Agent runs Beats under the hood. But note that
the Beats managed by Elastic Agent are set up and run differently from standalone
Beats.</p>
<p>For example, standalone Beats use modules and require you to run a setup
command on the host to load assets, such as ingest pipelines and dashboards. In
contrast, Beats managed by Elastic Agent use integration packages that Kibana
downloads from the Elastic Package Registry at <code class="literal">epr.elastic.co</code>. This means that
Elastic Agent does not need extra privileges to set up assets because
Fleet manages the assets.</p>
<h3><a id="what-is-the-endpoint-package"></a>What is the Endpoint Security integration in Fleet?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The Endpoint Security integration provides protection on your Elastic Agent
controlled host. The integration monitors your host for security-related events,
allowing for investigation of security data through the Elastic Security app in Kibana.
The Endpoint Security integration is managed by Elastic Agent in the
same way as other integrations. Try it out! For more information, see the
<a href="/guide/en/security/7.15/index.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Security documentation</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="how-are-security-to-agent-communications-secured"></a>How are communications secured between Elastic Security and Elastic Agent?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elastic Security connects to the agent over loopback TLS on port 6788.
Elastic Security validates that the agent has root (Linux and macOS) or SYSTEM
(Windows) permissions.</p>
<h3><a id="how-are-agent-kibana-communications-secured"></a>How are communications secured between Elastic Agent and Kibana?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elastic Agent connects to Kibana over TLS and authenticates the certificate
presented by Kibana. The agent then provides an API key as an authentication
token, which Kibana validates.</p>
<h3><a id="how-are-secrets-secured"></a>How are secrets secured when entered into integration policies or agent policies in Kibana?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Credentials that you provide for an agent or integration policy are stored in
Elasticsearch. They can be read by any user who has read permissions to the <code class="literal">.fleet-*</code>
and <code class="literal">.kibana*</code> indices in Elasticsearch. By default these are the superuser,
<code class="literal">fleet-server</code> service account tokens, and the <code class="literal">kibana_system</code> user. These
secrets are also included in agent policies and shared with agents via Fleet
through TLS. When you use the Elastic Agent installer and enroll agents in Fleet,
the policies are stored on the host file system and, by default, can only be
read by root.</p>
<h3><a id="which-es-kibana-ports-are-needed"></a>Which Elasticsearch and Kibana ports need to be accessible?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The policy generated by Fleet already contains the correct Elasticsearch address
and port for your setup. If you run everything locally, the address is
<code class="literal">127.0.0.1:9200</code>. If you use our
<a href="/cloud/elasticsearch-service?baymax=docs-body&amp;elektra=docs" class="ulink" target="_top">hosted Elasticsearch Service</a> on Elastic Cloud,
you can copy the Elasticsearch endpoint URL from the overview page of your deployment.
If you&#8217;re not running in Elastic Cloud, make sure the Kibana and Elasticsearch HTTPS ports
are both accessible; by default these are <code class="literal">5601</code> and <code class="literal">9200</code> respectively.</p>
<h3><a id="how-do-i-reinstall-a-missing-dashboard-asset"></a>If I delete an integration dashboard asset from Kibana, how do I get it back?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>To reinstall the assets for a specific integration, you can use the Fleet API using the package name and version. This needs to be run against the Kibana API and not the Elasticsearch API to be successful.
To reinstall package assets, execute the following call with the <code class="literal">force</code> parameter in the body:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">POST /api/fleet/epm/packages/[package name]-[package version]
{ "force": true }</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/4.console"></div>
<p>So, for example, to reinstall the system v1.0.0 package, POST:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">POST /api/fleet/epm/packages/system-1.0.0
{ "force": true }</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/5.console"></div>
<p>The package version is shown in the Integrations view in Kibana.</p>
