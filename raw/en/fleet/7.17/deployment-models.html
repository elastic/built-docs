<p>Administrators deploying the Elastic Agent have a few deployment choices
available to satisfy their organization&#8217;s requirements. Fleet Server can be
deployed:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
On Elastic Cloud, as part of our hosted Elasticsearch Service, which is managed by Elastic, or

</ul>

<h5><a id="deployed-in-cloud"></a>Deployed in Elastic Cloud<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.17/docs/en/ingest-management/fleet/fleet-server-deployment-models.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>To simplify the deployment of Elastic Agent, the Fleet Server can be
provisioned and hosted in the Elastic Cloud. In this case, when the deployment is
created, a highly available set of Fleet Servers are automatically deployed.</p>
<p>Administrators can choose the resources allocated to the Fleet Server and
whether they want the Fleet Server to be deployed in multiple availability
zones.</p>
<p>Once deployed on Elastic Cloud as a service, the full life cycle of the
Fleet Server is managed by Elastic. Fleet Server is scalable and highly
available with traffic ingress load balanced across multiple instances to
satisfy the scale requirements.</p>

<p>Fleet Server can be deployed on-premises and managed by the user. In this
deployment model, the administrator is responsible for Fleet Server deployment
and lifecycle management. This mode of operation is predominantly chosen to
satisfy data governance requirements or used in scenarios where the agents only
have access to a private segmented network.</p>
<p>It’s recommended that the administrator provision multiple instances of the
Fleet Server and use a load balancer to better scale the deployment.</p>

<p>Fleet Server is stateless. Connections to the Fleet Server therefore can be
load balanced as long as the Fleet Server has capacity to accept more
connections. Load balancing is done on a round-robin basis.</p>
<p>In the Elastic Cloud deployment model, multiple Fleet Servers are automatically
provisioned to satisfy the instance size chosen (instance sizes are modified to
satisfy the scale requirement). In addition, if you choose multiple
availability zones to address your fault-tolerance requirements, those
instances are also utilized to balance the load.</p>
<p>In an on-prem deployment, high-availability, fault-tolerance, and lifecycle
management of the Fleet Server are the responsibility of the administrator.</p>
