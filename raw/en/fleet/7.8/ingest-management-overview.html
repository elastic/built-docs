<p>Elastic Agent is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and
other types of data to each host. A single Agent makes it easier and faster
to deploy monitoring across your infrastructure. The Agent&#8217;s single, unified
configuration makes it easier to add integrations for new data sources.</p>

<p>Ingest Manager provides a web-based UI in Kibana to add and manage integrations
for popular services and platforms, as well as manage a fleet of Elastic Agents. Our
integrations provide an easy way to add new sources of data, plus they ship
with out-of-the-box assets like dashboards, visualizations, and pipelines to
extract structured fields out of logs. This makes it easier to get insights
within seconds.</p>

<h3><a id="configuring-integrations"></a>Integrations in Ingest Manager<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.8/docs/en/ingest-management/ingest-management-overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Ingest Manager provides a web-based UI for configuring integrations with your
data sources. This includes popular services and platforms like Nginx or AWS,
as well as many generic input types like log files.</p>
<p>The Elastic Agent configuration allows you to use any number of integrations for
data sources. You can apply the Elastic Agent configuration to multiple Agents,
making it even easier to manage configuration at scale.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/data-source.png" alt="Configuring a data source">
</div>
</div>
<p>You define a data source by supplying a name and description. Then you
configure inputs for logs and metrics, such as the path to your Nginx access
logs. When you&#8217;re done, you save the data source to update the Elastic Agent
configuration. The next time enrolled Agents check in, they receive the update.
Having the configurations automatically deployed is more convenient
than doing it yourself by using SSH, Ansible playbooks, or some other tool.</p>
<p>If you prefer infrastructure as code, you may use YAML files and APIs.
Ingest Manager has an API-first design. Anything you can do in the UI, you
can also do using the API. This makes it easy to automate and integrate with
other systems.</p>

<p>You can see the state of all your Elastic Agents on the Fleet page. Here you can see
which Agents are online, which have errors, and the last time they checked in.
You can also see the version of the Elastic Agent binary and configuration.</p>

<p>Fleet serves as the communication channel back to the Elastic Agents. Agents check
in for the latest updates on a regular basis. You can have any number of Agents
enrolled into each Agent configuration, which allows you to scale up to
thousands of hosts. When you make a change to an Agent configuration, all the
Agents receive the update during their next check-in. You no longer have to
distribute configuration updates yourself using SSH, Ansible playbooks, or other
configuration methods.</p>
<h4><a id="data-streams"></a>Data streams make index management easier<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.8/docs/en/ingest-management/ingest-management-overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The data collected by Elastic Agent is stored in indices that are more granular than
you’d get by default with Filebeat. This gives you more visibility into the
sources of data volume, and control over lifecycle management policies and index
permissions. These indices are called <em>data streams</em>. We will have more
improvements on this concept in future releases.</p>
<p>As you can see in the following screen, each data stream (or index) is broken
out by dataset, type, and namespace.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/data-streams.png" alt="Data streams page">
</div>
</div>
<p>The <em>dataset</em> is defined by the integration and describes the fields and other
settings for each index. For example, you might have one dataset for process
metrics with a field describing whether the process is running or not, and
another dataset for disk I/O metrics with a field describing the number of bytes
read.</p>
<p>This indexing strategy solves the issue of having indices with hundreds or
thousands of fields. Because each index stores only a small number of fields,
the indices are more compact with faster autocomplete. And as an added
bonus, the Discover page only shows relevant fields.</p>
<p><em>Namespaces</em> are user-defined strings that allow you to group data any way you
like. For example, you might group your data by environment (<code class="literal">prod</code>, <code class="literal">QA</code>) or by
team name. Using a namespace makes it easier to search the data from a given
source by using index patterns, or to give users permissions to data by
assigning an index pattern to user roles. Many of our customers already organize
their indices this way, and now we are providing this best practice as a
default.</p>
<p>When searching your data in Kibana, you can use an
<a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.8/index-patterns.html" class="ulink" target="_top">index pattern</a> to search across all or some of
the indices.</p>
