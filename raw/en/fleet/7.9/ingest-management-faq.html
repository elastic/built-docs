<h3><a id="enrolled-agent-not-showing-up"></a>Why doesn&#8217;t my enrolled Agent show up in the Ingest Manager app?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.9/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If Elastic Agent was successfully enrolled, but doesn&#8217;t show up in the Fleet list,
it might not be started. You need to <a class="xref" href="run-elastic-agent.html" title="Run Elastic Agent">start Elastic Agent</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="where-are-the-agent-logs"></a>Where does Elastic Agent store logs after startup?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.9/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When started successfully, Metricbeat logs are stored in
<code class="literal">data/logs/metricbeat</code> under the folder where Elastic Agent was started. If that log
path does not exist, Elastic Agent was unable to start Metricbeat, which is a
higher level problem to triage.</p>
<h3><a id="what-is-my-agent-config"></a>What configuration is the Elastic Agent running?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.9/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>To find the configuration file, inspect the <code class="literal">elastic-agent.yml</code> file in the
folder where you ran Elastic Agent. If you&#8217;re running the agent in Fleet mode, this
file contains the following citation:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">Management: mode: "fleet"</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code class="literal">action_store.yml</code> contains the entire, unencrypted configuration:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
To see the Elasticsearch location, look at <code class="literal">outputs:hosts</code>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To see the Elastic Agent version, look at the download folder and zip filenames.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This file also shows the version of all packages used by the current
configuration.</p>
<h3><a id="where-is-the-data-agent-is-sending"></a>Why can&#8217;t I see the data Elastic Agent is sending?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.9/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If Elastic Agent is set up and running, but you don&#8217;t see data in Kibana:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Go to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Management &gt; Dev Tools</strong></span> in Kibana, and in the Console, search your
index for data. For example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET metrics-*/_search</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1.console"></div>
<p>Or if you prefer, go to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Discover</strong></span> app.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Look at the data that Elastic Agent has sent and see if the <code class="literal">name.host</code>
field contains your host machine name.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If you don&#8217;t see data for your host, it&#8217;s possible that the data is blocked
in the network, or that a firewall or security problem is preventing the Elastic Agent
from sending the data.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s redundant to install stand-alone Metricbeat, you might want to
try installing it to see if it&#8217;s able to send data successfully to Elasticsearch. For
more information, see
<a href="/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/7.9/metricbeat-installation-configuration.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Metricbeat quick start</a>.</p>
<p>If Metricbeat is able to send data to Elasticsearch, there is possibly a bug or
problem with Elastic Agent, and you should report it.</p>
<h3><a id="i-deleted-my-agent"></a>How do I restore an Elastic Agent that I deleted from Fleet?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.9/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s ok, we&#8217;ve got your back! The data is still in Elasticsearch. To add Elastic Agent
to Fleet again, <a class="xref" href="stop-elastic-agent.html" title="Stop Elastic Agent">Stop Elastic Agent</a>, re-enroll it on the host, then
run Elastic Agent.</p>
<h3><a id="i-rebooted-my-host"></a>How do I restart Elastic Agent after rebooting my host?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.9/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>On Windows, if you used PowerShell to install Elastic Agent as a service, the agent
should still be running after rebooting the host.</p>
<p>On Linux, if you used the DEB or RPM packages, the agent should still be running
after rebooting the host.</p>
<p>On macOS, you need to restart Elastic Agent from the command line after
rebooting the host, or follow the steps described in
<a class="xref" href="elastic-agent-installation.html#elastic-agent-install-service-macos" title="Manually install Elastic Agent as a service on macOS">Manually install Elastic Agent as a service on macOS</a> to run the agent as a service.</p>
<p>Support for installing Elastic Agent as a service on all supported systems will be
available in a future release.</p>
<h3><a id="does-agent-download-packages"></a>Does Elastic Agent or Kibana download integration packages?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.9/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elastic Agent does not download integration packages. When you add an integration in
Ingest Manager, Kibana connects to the Elastic Package Registry at <code class="literal">epr-7-9.elastic.co</code>,
downloads the integration package, and stores its assets in Elasticsearch. This means
that you no longer have to run a manual setup command to load integrations as
you did previously with Beats modules.</p>
<h3><a id="does-agent-download-anything-from-internet"></a>Does Elastic Agent download anything from the Internet?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.9/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, the data collection software required by Elastic Agent is bundled
with the agent. There is one special exception: Elastic Endpoint. When an
Elastic Agent configuration is set to include Elastic Endpoint, Elastic Agent must download
software from the Elastic download site.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Bundling Elastic Endpoint with Elastic Agent is a known feature request scoped
for a future release.</p>
</div>

<h3><a id="do-i-need-to-setup-elastic-agent"></a>Do I need to set up the Beats managed by Elastic Agent?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.9/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You might have noticed that Elastic Agent runs Beats under the hood. But note that
the Beats managed by Elastic Agent are set up and run differently from standalone
Beats.</p>
<p>For example, standalone Beats use modules and require you to run a setup
command on the host to load assets, such as ingest pipelines and dashboards. In
contrast, Beats managed by Elastic Agent use integration packages that Kibana
downloads from the Elastic Package Registry at <code class="literal">epr-7-9.elastic.co</code>. This means that
Elastic Agent does not need extra privileges to set up assets because
Ingest Manager manages the assets.</p>
<h3><a id="what-is-the-endpoint-package"></a>What is the Elastic Endpoint Security integration in Ingest Manager?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/7.9/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The Elastic Endpoint Security integration provides protection on your Elastic Agent
controlled host. The integration monitors your host for security-related events,
allowing for investigation of security data through the Elastic Security
application in Kibana. The Elastic Endpoint Security integration is managed by
Elastic Agent in in the same way as other integrations. Try it out! For more
information, see the <a href="/guide/en/security/7.9/index.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Security solution
documentation</a>.</p>
