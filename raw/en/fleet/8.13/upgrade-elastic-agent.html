<p>With Fleet upgrade capabilities, you can view and select agents that are out
of date, and trigger selected agents to download, install, and run the new
version. You can trigger upgrades to happen immediately, or specify a
maintenance window during which the upgrades will occur. If your Elastic Stack
subscription level supports it, you can schedule upgrades to occur at a specific
date and time.</p>
<p>In most failure cases the Elastic Agent may retry an upgrade after a short wait. The
wait durations between retries are: 1m, 5m, 10m, 15m, 30m, and 1h. During this
time, the Elastic Agent may show up as "retrying" in the Fleet UI. As well, if agent
upgrades have been detected to have stalled, you can restart the upgrade process
for a <a class="xref" href="upgrade-elastic-agent.html#restart-upgrade-single" title="Restart an upgrade for a single agent">single agent</a> or in bulk for
<a class="xref" href="upgrade-elastic-agent.html#restart-upgrade-multiple" title="Restart an upgrade for multiple agents">multiple agents</a>.</p>
<p>This approach simplifies the process of keeping your agents up to date. It also
saves you time because you don&#8217;t need third-party tools or processes to
manage upgrades.</p>
<p>By default, Elastic Agents require internet access to perform binary upgrades from
Fleet. However, you can host your own artifacts repository and configure
Elastic Agents to download binaries from it. For more information, refer to
<a class="xref" href="air-gapped.html" title="Air-gapped environments">Air-gapped environments</a>.</p>

<p>Under routine circumstances, an Elastic Agent upgrade happens quickly. You typically will not see the agent transition through each of the upgrade states. The detailed upgrade status can be a very useful tool especially if you need to diagnose the state of an agent that may have become stuck, or just appears to have become stuck, during the upgrade process.</p>
<p>Beside the upgrade status indicator, you can hover your cursor over the information icon to get more detail about the upgrade.</p>

<p>When upgrading many agents, you can fine tune the maintenance window by
viewing stats and metrics about the upgrade:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">

<p>An Elastic Agent upgrade process may sometimes stall. This can happen for various
reasons, including, for example, network connectivity issues or a delayed shutdown.</p>
<p>When an Elastic Agent upgrade has been detected to be stuck, a warning indicator
appears on the UI. When this occurs, you can restart the upgrade from either the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Agents</strong></span> tab on the main Fleet page or from the details page for any individual
agent.</p>
<p>Note that there is a required 10 minute cooldown period in between restart attempts.
After launching a restart action you need to wait for the cooldown to complete before
initiating another restart.</p>
<p>Restart from main Fleet page:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
From the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Actions</strong></span> menu next to an agent that is stuck in an <code class="literal">Updating</code>
