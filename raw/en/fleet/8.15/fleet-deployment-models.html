<p>There are various models for setting up Elastic Agents to work with Elasticsearch.
The recommended approach is to use Fleet, a web-based UI in Kibana, to centrally manage all of your Elastic Agents and their policies.
Using Fleet requires having an instance of Fleet Server that acts as the interface between the Fleet UI and your Elastic Agents.</p>
<p>For an overview of Fleet Server, including details about how it communicates with Elasticsearch, how to ensure high availability, and more, refer to <a class="xref" href="fleet-server.html" title="What is Fleet Server?">What is Fleet Server?</a>.</p>
<p>The requirements for setting up Fleet Server differ, depending on your particular deployment model:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Elastic Cloud serverless
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
In a <a href="https://docs.elastic.co/serverless" class="ulink" target="_top">serverless</a> environment, Fleet Server is offered as a service, it is configured and scaled automatically without the need for any user intervention.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Elasticsearch Service
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
If you&#8217;re running Elasticsearch and Kibana hosted on <a href="/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-getting-started.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Service</a>, no extra setup is required unless you want to scale your deployment. Elasticsearch Service runs a hosted version of Integrations Server that includes Fleet Server. For details about this deployment model, refer to <a class="xref" href="add-fleet-server-cloud.html" title="Deploy on Elastic Cloud">Deploy on Elastic Cloud</a>.

<dt>
<span class="term">
Elasticsearch Service with Fleet Server on-premise
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
When you use a hosted Elasticsearch Service deployment you may still choose to run Fleet Server on-premise. For details about this deployment model and set up instructions, refer to <a class="xref" href="add-fleet-server-mixed.html" title="Deploy Fleet Server on-premises and Elasticsearch on Cloud">Deploy Fleet Server on-premises and Elasticsearch on Cloud</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Self-managed
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
For self-managed deployments, you must install and host Fleet Server yourself. For details about this deployment model and set up instructions, refer to <a class="xref" href="add-fleet-server-on-prem.html" title="Deploy on-premises and self-managed">Deploy on-premises and self-managed</a>.
