<p>To use Fleet for central management, a <a class="xref" href="fleet-server.html" title="Set up Fleet Server">Fleet Server</a> must
be running and accessible to your hosts. There are a few approaches you can take
when deploying Fleet Server:</p>

<p>Fleet Server can be provisioned and hosted on Elastic Cloud. In this case,
when the deployment is created, a highly available set of Fleet Servers
is automatically deployed.</p>
<p>This approach might be right for you if you want to reduce on-prem compute resources
and you&#8217;d like Elastic to take care of provisioning and life cycle management of
your deployment.</p>
<p>With this approach, multiple Fleet Servers are automatically provisioned to satisfy
the chosen instance size (instance sizes are modified to satisfy the scale requirement).
You can also choose the resources allocated to each Fleet Server and whether you want
each Fleet Server to be deployed in multiple availability zones.
If you choose multiple availability zones to address your fault-tolerance
requirements, those instances are also utilized to balance the load.</p>
<p>This approach might <em>not</em> be right for you if you have restrictions on connectivity
to the internet.</p>

<h4><a id="deployed-on-prem"></a>Deploy Fleet Server on-premises<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.6/docs/en/ingest-management/fleet/add-fleet-server.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Alternatively, you can deploy Fleet Server on-premises and manage it yourself.
In this deployment model, you are responsible for high-availability, fault-tolerance,
and lifecycle management of Fleet Server.</p>
<p>This approach might be right for you if you would like to limit the control plane traffic
out of your data center or have requirements for fully air-gapped operations.
For example, you might take this approach if you need to satisfy data governance requirements
or you want agents to only have access to a private segmented network.</p>
<p>This approach might <em>not</em> be right for you if you don&#8217;t want to manage the life cycle
of your Elastic environment and instead would like that to be handled by Elastic.</p>
<p>When using this approach, it&#8217;s recommended that you provision multiple instances of
the Fleet Server and use a load balancer to better scale the deployment.
You also have the option to use your organization&#8217;s certificate to establish a
secure connection from Fleet Server to Elasticsearch.</p>

<p>Another approach is to deploy a cluster of Fleet Servers on-premises and
connect them back to Elastic Cloud with access to Elasticsearch and Kibana.
In this deployment model, you are responsible for high-availability, fault-tolerance,
and lifecycle management of Fleet Server.</p>
<p>This approach might be right for you if you would like to limit the control plane traffic
out of your data center. For example, you might take this approach if you are a
managed service provider or a larger enterprise that segregates its networks.</p>
<p>This approach might <em>not</em> be right for you if you don&#8217;t want to manage the life cycle
of an extra compute resource in your environment for Fleet Server to reside on.</p>
