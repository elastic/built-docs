<p>By default, Kibana requires an internet connection to download
integration packages from the Elastic Package Registry. Make sure the Kibana
server can connect to <code class="literal">https://epr.elastic.co</code> on port <code class="literal">443</code>. If network
restrictions prevent Kibana from reaching the public Elastic Package Registry,
you can use a proxy server or host your own Elastic Package Registry. To learn

<p>Some integration packages, like System, are installed by default during Fleet
setup. These integrations are upgraded automatically when Fleet detects that a
new version is available. These integrations have an option to upgrade
integration policies automatically, too. When this option is selected (the
default), Fleet automatically upgrades your policies behind the scenes when a
new version of the integration is available. If there are conflicts during the
upgrade, your integration policies will not be upgraded, and you&#8217;ll need to

<p>When attempting to upgrade an integration policy, it&#8217;s possible that
breaking changes or conflicts exist between versions of an integration. For
example, if a new version of an integration has a required field and doesn&#8217;t
specify a default value, Fleet cannot perform the upgrade without user input.
Conflicts are also likely if an experimental package greatly restructures its
fields and configuration settings between releases.</p>
<p>If Fleet detects a conflict while automatically upgrading an integration
policy, it will not attempt to upgrade it. You&#8217;ll need to:</p>
