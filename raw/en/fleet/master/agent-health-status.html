<p>The Elastic Agent <a class="xref" href="monitor-elastic-agent.html" title="Monitor Elastic Agents">monitoring documentation</a> describes the features available through the Fleet UI for you to view Elastic Agent status and activity, access metrics and diagnostics, enable alerts, and more.</p>
<p>For details about how the Elastic Agent status is monitored by Fleet, including connectivity, check-in frequency, and similar, see the following:</p>

<p>After enrollment, Elastic Agent regularly initiates a check-in to Fleet Server using HTTP long-polling (Fleet Server is either deployed on-premises or deployed as part of Elasticsearch in Elastic Cloud).</p>
<p>The HTTP long-polling request is kept open until there&#8217;s a configuration change that Elastic Agent needs to consume, an action that is sent to the agent, or a 5 minute timeout has elapsed. After 5 minutes, the agent will again send another check-in to start the process over again.</p>
<p>The frequency of check-ins can be configured to a new value with the condition that it may affect the maximum number of agents that can connect to Fleet. Our regular scale testing of the solution doesn&#8217;t modify this parameter.</p>

<p>No. The health monitoring of Elastic Agent and its inputs, as reported in Fleet, is done completely outside of what stack monitoring provides.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h5><a id="agent-health-status-other-components"></a>There are many components that make up Elastic Agent. How does Elastic Agent ensure that these components/processes are up and running, and healthy?</h5><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/fleet/agent-health-status.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Elastic Agent is essentially a supervisor that (at a minimum) will deploy a Filebeat instance for log collection and a Metricbeat instance for metrics collection from the system and applications running on that system. As a supervisor, it also ensures that these spawned processes are running and healthy. Using gRPC, Elastic Agent communicates with the underlying processes once every 30 seconds, ensuring their health. If there&#8217;s no response, the agent will transfer to being <code class="literal">Unhealthy</code> with the result and details reported to Fleet.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h5><a id="agent-health-status-outage"></a>If Elastic Agent goes down, is an alert generated by Fleet?</h5><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/fleet/agent-health-status.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>No. Alerts would have to be created in Kibana on the indices that show the total count of agents at each specific state. Refer to <a class="xref" href="monitor-elastic-agent.html#fleet-alerting" title="Enable alerts and ML jobs based on Fleet and Elastic Agent status">Enable alerts and ML jobs based on Fleet and Elastic Agent status</a> in the Elastic Agent monitoring documentation for the steps to configure alerting. Generating alerts on status change on individual agents is currently planned for a future release.</p>

<p>Some Elastic Agent states are reported immediately, such as when the agent has become <code class="literal">Unhealthy</code>. Some other states are derived after a certain criteria is met. Refer to <a class="xref" href="monitor-elastic-agent.html#view-agent-status" title="View agent status overview">View agent status overview</a> in the Elastic Agent monitoring documentation for details about monitoring agent status.</p>
<p>Transition from an <code class="literal">Offline</code> state to an <code class="literal">Inactive</code> state is configurable by the user and that transition can be fine tuned by <a class="xref" href="set-inactivity-timeout.html" title="Set inactivity timeout">Setting the inactivity timeout parameter</a>.</p>
