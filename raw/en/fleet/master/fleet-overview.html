<p>Elastic Agent is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other
types of data to a host. It can also protect hosts from security threats, query
data from operating systems, forward data from remote services or hardware, and
more. A single agent makes it easier and faster to deploy monitoring across your
infrastructure. Each agent has a single policy you can update to add
integrations for new data sources, security protections, and more.</p>
<p>As the following diagram illustrates, Elastic Agent can monitor the host where it&#8217;s
deployed, and it can collect and forward data from remote services and hardware
where direct deployment is not possible.</p>

<h3><a id="unified-integrations"></a>Integrations<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic integrations</a> provide an easy way to connect Elastic to external services and systems, and quickly get insights or take action.
They can collect new sources of data, and they often ship
with out-of-the-box assets like dashboards, visualizations, and pipelines to
extract structured fields out of logs and events. This makes it easier to get insights
within seconds. Integrations are available for popular services and platforms
like Nginx or AWS, as well as many generic input types like log files.</p>
<p>Kibana provides a web-based UI to add and manage integrations. You can browse a
unified view of available integrations that shows both Elastic Agent and Beats
integrations.</p>

<h3><a id="configuring-integrations"></a>Elastic Agent policies<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Agent policies specify which integrations you want to run and on which hosts.
You can apply an Elastic Agent policy to multiple
agents, making it even easier to manage configuration at scale.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/add-integration.png" alt="Add integration page">
</div>
</div>
<p>When you add an integration, you configure inputs for logs and metrics, such as the path to your Nginx access
logs. When you&#8217;re done, you save the integration to an Elastic Agent
policy. The next time enrolled agents check in, they receive the update.
Having the policies automatically deployed is more convenient
than doing it yourself by using SSH, Ansible playbooks, or some other tool.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to <a class="xref" href="agent-policy.html" title="Elastic Agent policies">Policies</a>.</p>
<p>If you prefer infrastructure as code, you may use YAML files and APIs.
Fleet has an API-first design. Anything you can do in the UI, you
can also do using the <a href="/guide/en/fleet/master/fleet-api-docs.html" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">API</code></a>.
This makes it easy to automate and integrate with other systems.</p>
<h3><a id="package-registry-intro"></a>Elastic Package Registry<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The Elastic Package Registry is an online package hosting service for the Elastic Agent
integrations available in Kibana.</p>
<p>Kibana connects to the Elastic Package Registry at <code class="literal">epr.elastic.co</code> using the Elastic
Package Manager, downloads the latest integration package, and stores its assets
in Elasticsearch. This process typically requires an internet connection because
integrations are updated and released periodically. You can find more information about running the Elastic Package Registry in air-gapped
environments in the section about <a href="/guide/en/fleet/master/air-gapped.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Air-gapped environments</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="artifact-registry-intro"></a>Elastic Artifact Registry<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Fleet and Elastic Agent require access to the public Elastic Artifact Registry. The Elastic Agent running on any of your internal hosts should have access to <code class="literal">artifacts.elastic.co</code> in order to perform self-upgrades and install of certain components which are needed for some of the data integrations.</p>
<p>Additionally, access to <code class="literal">artifacts.security.elastic.co</code> is needed for Elastic Agent updates and security artifacts when using Elastic Defend.</p>
<p>You can find more information about running the above mentioned resources in air-gapped
environments in the section about <a href="/guide/en/fleet/master/air-gapped.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Air-gapped environments</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="central-management"></a>Central management in Fleet<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Fleet provides a web-based UI in Kibana for centrally managing Elastic Agents and
their policies.</p>
<p>You can see the state of all your Elastic Agents in Fleet. On the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Agents</strong></span> page,
you can see which agents are healthy or unhealthy, and the last time they
checked in. You can also see the version of the Elastic Agent binary and policy.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/kibana-fleet-agents.png" alt="Agents page">
</div>
</div>
<p>Fleet serves as the communication channel back to the Elastic Agents. Agents check
in for the latest updates on a regular basis. You can have any number of agents
enrolled into each agent policy, which allows you to scale up to
thousands of hosts.</p>
<p>When you make a change to an agent policy, all the agents receive the update
during their next check-in. You no longer have to distribute policy updates
yourself.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re ready to upgrade your Elastic Agent binaries or integrations, you can
initiate upgrades in Fleet, and the Elastic Agents running on your hosts will
upgrade automatically.</p>
<h4><a id="selective-agent-management"></a>Roll out changes to many Elastic Agents quickly<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Some subscription levels support bulk select operations, including:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Selective binary updates
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Selective agent policy reassignment
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Selective agent unenrollment
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This capability enables you to apply changes and trigger updates across many
Elastic Agents so you can roll out changes quickly across your organization.</p>

<h3><a id="fleet-server-intro"></a>Fleet Server<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Fleet Server is the mechanism to connect Elastic Agents to Fleet.  It allows for
a scalable infrastructure and is supported in Elastic Cloud and self-managed clusters.
Fleet Server is a separate process that communicates with the deployed Elastic Agents.
It can be started from any available x64 architecture Elastic Agent artifact.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to <a class="xref" href="fleet-server.html" title="What is Fleet Server?">What is Fleet Server?</a>.</p>

<p class="title"><strong>Fleet Server with Elastic Cloud serverless</strong></p>
</div></div></div>
<p>On-premises Fleet Server is not currently available for use with
<a href="https://docs.elastic.co/serverless" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Cloud serverless</a> projects. In a serverless
environment we recommend using Fleet Server on Elastic Cloud.</p>

<h3><a id="fleet-communication-layer"></a>Elasticsearch as the communication layer<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>All communication between the Fleet UI and Fleet Server happens through
Elasticsearch. Fleet writes policies, actions, and any changes to the <code class="literal">fleet-*</code>
indices in Elasticsearch. Each Fleet Server monitors the indices, picks up changes, and
ships them to the Elastic Agents. To communicate to Fleet about the status of the
Elastic Agents and the policy rollout, the Fleet Servers write updates to the
<code class="literal">fleet-*</code> indices.</p>
<h3><a id="agent-self-protection"></a>Elastic Agent self-protection<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>On macOS and Windows, when the Elastic Defend integration is added to the
agent policy, Elastic Endpoint can prevent malware from executing on
the host. For more information, refer to
<a href="/guide/en/security/master/es-overview.html#self-protection" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Endpoint self-protection</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="data-streams-intro"></a>Data streams make index management easier<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The data collected by Elastic Agent is stored in indices that are more granular than
you&#8217;d get by default with the Beats shippers or APM Server. This gives you more visibility into the
sources of data volume, and control over lifecycle management policies and index
permissions. These indices are called <a class="xref" href="data-streams.html" title="Data streams"><em>data streams</em></a>.</p>
