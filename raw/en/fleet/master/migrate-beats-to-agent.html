<p>Elastic Agent and Beats provide similar functionality for log collection and
host monitoring, but Elastic Agent has some distinct advantages over Beats.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Easier to deploy and manage.</strong></span> Instead of deploying multiple Beats,
you deploy a single Elastic Agent. The Elastic Agent downloads, configures, and manages any
underlying programs required to collect and parse your data.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Easier to configure.</strong></span> You no longer have to define and manage separate
configuration files for each Beat running on a host. Instead you define a single
agent policy that specifies which integration settings to use, and the Elastic Agent
generates the configuration required by underlying programs, like Beats.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Central management.</strong></span> Unlike Beats, which require you to set up your own
automation strategy for upgrades and configuration management, Elastic Agents can be
managed from a central location in Kibana called Fleet. In Fleet, you can
view the status of running Elastic Agents, update agent policies and push them to your
hosts, and even trigger binary upgrades.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Endpoint protection.</strong></span> Probably the biggest advantage of using Elastic Agent is that
it enables you to protect your endpoints from security threats.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a id="_limitations_and_requirements"></a>Limitations and requirements<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/migrate-beats-to-agent.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>There are currently some limitations and requirements to be aware of before
migrating to Elastic Agent:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>No support for configuring the Beats internal queue.</strong></span>
Each Beat has an internal queue that stores events before batching and
publishing them to the output. To improve data throughput, Beats users can set
<a href="/guide/en/beats/filebeat/master/configuring-internal-queue.html" class="ulink" target="_top">configuration options</a> to tune
the performance of the internal queue. However, the endless fine tuning
required to configure the queue is cumbersome and not always fruitful. Instead
of expecting users to configure the internal queue, Elastic Agent uses sensible
defaults. This means you won&#8217;t be able to migrate internal queue configurations
to Elastic Agent.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Before you begin:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review your existing Beats configurations and make a list of the
integrations that are required. For example, if your existing implementation
collects logs and metrics from Nginx, add Nginx to your list.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Make a note of any processors or custom configurations you want to migrate.
Some of these customizations may no longer be needed or possible in Elastic Agent.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Decide if it&#8217;s the right time to migrate to Elastic Agent. Review the information
under <a class="xref" href="beats-agent-comparison.html" title="Beats and Elastic Agent capabilities"><em>Beats and Elastic Agent capabilities</em></a>. Make sure the integrations you need
are supported and Generally Available, and that the output and features you
require are also supported.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If everything checks out, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, you might want
to continue using Beats and possibly deploy Elastic Agent alongside Beats to
use features like endpoint protection.</p>

<p>To use Fleet for central management, a <a class="xref" href="fleet-server.html" title="What is Fleet Server?">Fleet Server</a> must be

<p>To begin the migration, deploy an Elastic Agent to a host where Beats shippers are
running. It&#8217;s recommended that you set up and test the migration in a
development environment before deploying across your infrastructure.</p>
<p>You can continue to run Beats alongside Elastic Agent until you&#8217;re satisfied with
the data its sending to Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>Read <a class="xref" href="elastic-agent-installation.html" title="Install Elastic Agents"><em>Install Elastic Agents</em></a> to learn how to deploy an Elastic Agent. To
save time, return to this page when the Elastic Agent is deployed, healthy, and

<p>Here&#8217;s a high-level overview to help you understand the deployment process.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div>
<p class="title"><strong>Overview of the Elastic Agent deployment process</strong></p>

<p>During the deployment process you:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Create an agent policy.</strong></span> An agent policy is similar to a configuration file,
but unlike a regular configuration file, which needs to be maintained on many
different host systems, you can configure and maintain the agent policy in a
central location in Fleet and apply it to multiple Elastic Agents.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Add integrations to the agent policy.</strong></span> Elastic Agent integrations provide a simple,
unified way to collect data from popular apps and services, and protect systems
from security threats. To define the agent policy, you add integrations for each
service or system you want to monitor. For example, to collect logs and metrics
from a system running Nginx, you might add the Nginx integration and the System
integration.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>What happens when you add an integration to an agent policy?</strong></span> The assets for the
integration, such as dashboards and ingest pipelines, get installed if they
aren&#8217;t already. Plus the settings you specify for the integration, such as how
to connect to the source system or locate logs, are added as an integration
policy.</p>
<p>For the example described earlier, you would have an agent policy that
contains two integration policies: one for collecting Nginx logs and metrics,
and another for collecting system logs and metrics.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Install Elastic Agent on the host and enroll it in the agent policy.</strong></span> When you
enroll the Elastic Agent in an agent policy, the agent gets added to Fleet, where
you can monitor and manage the agent.

<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>It&#8217;s best to add one integration at a time and test it before adding more

get started if it&#8217;s supported on your OS.</p>

<p>Now that you&#8217;ve deployed an Elastic Agent to your host and it&#8217;s successfully sending

<p>For example, if the agent policy you created earlier includes the System

<p>When you save and deploy your changes, the agent policy is updated to include a

<h3><a id="_migrate_processor_configurations"></a>Migrate processor configurations<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/migrate-beats-to-agent.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Processors enable you to filter and enhance the data before it’s sent to the
output. Each processor receives an event, applies a defined action to the event,
and returns the event. If you define a list of processors, they are executed in
the order they are defined. Elastic provides a
<a href="/guide/en/beats/filebeat/master/defining-processors.html" class="ulink" target="_top">rich set of processors</a> that are
supported by all Beats and by Elastic Agent.</p>
<p>Prior to migrating from Beats, you defined processors in the configuration
file for each Beat. After migrating to Elastic Agent, however, the Beats
configuration files are redundant. All configuration is policy-driven from
Fleet (or for advanced use cases, specified in a standalone agent policy). Any
processors you defined previously in the Beats configuration need to be added
to an integration policy; they cannot be defined in the Beats configuration.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Globally-defined processors are not currently supported by Elastic Agent.
You must define processors in each integration policy where they are required.</p>

<p>In some cases, Beats modules preserve the original, raw event, which consumes
more storage space, but may be a requirement for compliance or forensic use
cases.</p>

<h3><a id="_migrate_custom_dashboards"></a>Migrate custom dashboards<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/ingest-docs/edit/main/docs/en/ingest-management/migrate-beats-to-agent.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elastic integration packages provide many assets, such as pre-built dashboards,
to make it easier for you to visualize your data. In some cases, however, you
might have custom dashboards you want to migrate.</p>
<p>Because Elastic Agent uses different data streams, the fields exported by an Elastic Agent
are slightly different from those exported Beats. Any custom dashboards that
you created for Beats need to be modified or recreated to use the new fields.</p>
<p>You have a couple of options for migrating custom dashboards:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
(Recommended) Recreate the custom dashboards based on the new data streams.

<p>You may want to continue using your custom dashboards if the dashboards
installed with an integration are not adequate. To do this, use index aliases to

<p>For example, custom dashboards that point to <code class="literal">filebeat-</code> or <code class="literal">metricbeat-</code> can be

<p>Any installed Beats shippers will continue to work until you remove them. This
allows you to roll out the migration in stages. You will continue to see
duplicated data until you remove Beats.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re satisfied with your Elastic Agent deployment, remove Beats from your
hosts. All the data collected before installing the Elastic Agent will still be
available in Elasticsearch until you delete the data or it&#8217;s removed according to the
data retention policies you&#8217;ve specified for index lifecycle management.</p>
<p>To remove Beats from your host:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Stop the service by using the correct command for your system.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
(Optional) Back up your Beats configuration files in case you need to refer
to them in the future.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Delete the Beats installation directory. If necessary, stop any orphan
processes that are running after you stopped the service.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you added firewall rules to allow Beats to communicate on your network,
remove them.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
After you&#8217;ve removed all Beats, revoke any API keys or remove privileges for
any Beats users created to send data to Elasticsearch.
