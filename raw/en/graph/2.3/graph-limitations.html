<p>Currently the Graph API can explore multiple indices, types or aliases in a single API request but the assumption is
that each "hop" it performs will be querying the same set of indices.
It is currently not possible to take a term found in a field from one index and use that value to explore connections
in <em>a different field</em> held in another type or index. A good example of where that might be useful is if an ip address
found in the <code class="literal">remote_host</code> field of an index called "weblogs20160101" might want to be followed up by looking for
this value in the <code class="literal">ip_address</code> field of an index called "knownthreats". For the Graph API to support this, extra mapping
would be required to understand that the weblogs' <code class="literal">remote_host</code> field contained values that had currency and meaning in
the <code class="literal">ip_address</code> field of the threats index. Currently we do not support this translation and client code would need to
perform multiple calls to take the values from a weblogs index response and build them into a separate request to the threats index.</p>
