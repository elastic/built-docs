<h3><a id="enrolled-agent-not-showing-up"></a>Why doesn&#8217;t my enrolled agent show up in the Fleet app?<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/master/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If Elastic Agent was successfully enrolled, but doesn&#8217;t show up in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Agents</strong></span> list,
it might not be started. Make sure the <code class="literal">elastic-agent</code> process is running on
the host. If it&#8217;s not running, use the <a class="xref" href="elastic-agent-cmd-options.html#elastic-agent-run-command" title="elastic-agent run"><code class="literal">run</code></a>
command to start it.</p>
<h3><a id="where-are-the-agent-logs"></a>Where does Elastic Agent store logs after startup?<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/master/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When started successfully, Metricbeat logs are stored in
<code class="literal">data/logs/metricbeat</code> under the folder where Elastic Agent was started. If that log
path does not exist, Elastic Agent was unable to start Metricbeat, which is a
higher level problem to triage.</p>
<h3><a id="what-is-my-agent-config"></a>What policy is the Elastic Agent running?<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/master/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>To find the policy file, inspect the <code class="literal">elastic-agent.yml</code> file in the
folder where you ran Elastic Agent. If you&#8217;re running the agent in Fleet mode, this
file contains the following citation:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">Management: mode: "fleet"</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code class="literal">action_store.yml</code> contains the entire, unencrypted policy:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
To see the Elasticsearch location, look at <code class="literal">outputs:hosts</code>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To see the Elastic Agent version, look at the download folder and zip filenames.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This file also shows the version of all packages used by the current
policy.</p>
<h3><a id="where-is-the-data-agent-is-sending"></a>Why can&#8217;t I see the data Elastic Agent is sending?<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/master/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If Elastic Agent is set up and running, but you don&#8217;t see data in Kibana:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Go to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Management &gt; Dev Tools</strong></span> in Kibana, and in the Console, search your
index for data. For example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET metrics-*/_search</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1.console"></div>
<p>Or if you prefer, go to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Discover</strong></span> app.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Look at the data that Elastic Agent has sent and see if the <code class="literal">name.host</code>
field contains your host machine name.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If you don&#8217;t see data for your host, it&#8217;s possible that the data is blocked
in the network, or that a firewall or security problem is preventing the Elastic Agent
from sending the data.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s redundant to install stand-alone Metricbeat, you might want to
try installing it to see if it&#8217;s able to send data successfully to Elasticsearch. For
more information, see
<a href="/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/master/metricbeat-installation-configuration.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Metricbeat quick start</a>.</p>
<p>If Metricbeat is able to send data to Elasticsearch, there is possibly a bug or
problem with Elastic Agent, and you should report it.</p>
<h3><a id="i-deleted-my-agent"></a>How do I restore an Elastic Agent that I deleted from Fleet?<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/master/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s ok, we&#8217;ve got your back! The data is still in Elasticsearch. To add Elastic Agent
to Fleet again, <a class="xref" href="stop-elastic-agent.html" title="Stop Elastic Agent">Stop Elastic Agent</a>, re-enroll it on the host, then
run Elastic Agent.</p>
<h3><a id="i-rebooted-my-host"></a>How do I restart Elastic Agent after rebooting my host?<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/master/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elastic Agent should restart automatically when you reboot your host. If it doesn&#8217;t,
you can start it manually by running:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">elastic-agent run</pre>
</div>
<p>If the process is already running, you can restart it by running:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">elastic-agent restart</pre>
</div>
<h3><a id="does-agent-download-packages"></a>Does Elastic Agent or Kibana download integration packages?<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/master/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elastic Agent does not download integration packages. When you add an integration in
Fleet, Kibana connects to the Elastic Package Registry at <code class="literal">epr.elastic.co</code>,
downloads the integration package, and stores its assets in Elasticsearch. This means
that you no longer have to run a manual setup command to load integrations as
you did previously with Beats modules.</p>
<h3><a id="does-agent-download-anything-from-internet"></a>Does Elastic Agent download anything from the Internet?<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/master/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, the data collection software required by Elastic Agent is bundled
with the agent. There is one special exception: endpoint security. When an
Elastic Agent policy is set to include the Endpoint Security integration,
Elastic Agent must download software from the Elastic download site.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Bundling endpoint security capabilities with Elastic Agent is a known
feature request scoped for a future release.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><a id="do-i-need-to-setup-elastic-agent"></a>Do I need to set up the Beats managed by Elastic Agent?<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/master/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You might have noticed that Elastic Agent runs Beats under the hood. But note that
the Beats managed by Elastic Agent are set up and run differently from standalone
Beats.</p>
<p>For example, standalone Beats use modules and require you to run a setup
command on the host to load assets, such as ingest pipelines and dashboards. In
contrast, Beats managed by Elastic Agent use integration packages that Kibana
downloads from the Elastic Package Registry at <code class="literal">epr.elastic.co</code>. This means that
Elastic Agent does not need extra privileges to set up assets because
Fleet manages the assets.</p>
<h3><a id="what-is-the-endpoint-package"></a>What is the Endpoint Security integration in Ingest Manager?<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/master/docs/en/ingest-management/faq.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The Endpoint Security integration provides protection on your Elastic Agent
controlled host. The integration monitors your host for security-related events,
allowing for investigation of security data through the Elastic Security app in Kibana.
The Endpoint Security integration is managed by Elastic Agent in the
same way as other integrations. Try it out! For more information, see the
<a href="/guide/en/security/master/index.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Security solution documentation</a>.</p>
