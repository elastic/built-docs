<p>The Upgrade Assistant helps you prepare to upgrade from Elasticsearch 5.x to
Elasticsearch 6.0. It identifies deprecated settings, simplifies reindexing
your pre-5.x indices, and upgrades the internal indices used by Kibana and
X-Pack to the format required in 6.0.</p>
<p>To access the Upgrade Assistant, go to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Management</strong></span> and click the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Upgrade
Assistant</strong></span> link in the Elasticsearch section.</p>
<h3><a id="cluster-checkup"></a>Cluster Checkup<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/edit/6.1/docs/en/upgrade-assistant/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The first step in preparing to upgrade is to identify any deprecated settings
or features you are using. The Cluster Checkup runs a series of checks
against your cluster and indices and generates a report identifying
any issues that you need to resolve.</p>
<p>To run the Cluster Checkup, go to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Cluster Checkup</strong></span> tab in the
Upgrade Assistant. Issues that <span class="strong strong"><strong>must</strong></span> be resolved before you can upgrade to
Elasticsearch 6.0 appear in red as errors.</p>
<p>If the checkup finds indices that need to be reindexed, you can
manage that process with the Reindex Helper. You can also manually reindex or
simply delete old indices if you are sure you no longer need them.</p>
<h3><a id="reindex-helper"></a>Reindex Helper<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/edit/6.1/docs/en/upgrade-assistant/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If you have indices created in 2.x, you must reindex them before
upgrading to Elasticsearch 6.0. In addition, the internal Kibana and X-Pack
indices must be reindexed to upgrade them to the format required in 6.0.</p>
<p>To reindex indices with the Reindex Helper:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Back up your indices using <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/modules-snapshots.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Snapshot and Restore</a>.</strong></span>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Go to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Reindex Helper</strong></span> tab in the Upgrade Assistant.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Click the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Reindex</strong></span> button to reindex an index.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Monitor the reindex task that is kicked off.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>You can run any number of reindex tasks simultaneously. The processing status
is displayed for each index. You can stop a task by clicking <span class="strong strong"><strong>Cancel</strong></span>. If
any step in the reindex process fails, you can reset the index by clicking
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Reset</strong></span>.</p>
<p>You can also click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Refresh Indices</strong></span> to remove any indices that have been
successfully reindexed from the list.</p>
<p>Reindexing tasks continue to run when you leave the Reindex Helper. When you
come back, click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Refresh Indices</strong></span> to get the latest status of your indices.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>When you come back to the Reindex Helper, it shows any tasks that are
still running. You can cancel those tasks if you need to, but you won&#8217;t have
access to the task progress and are blocked from resetting indices that fail
reindexing. This is because the index might have been modified outside of
your Kibana instance.</p>

<h3><a id="toggle-deprecation-logger"></a>Toggle Deprecation Logger<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-kibana/edit/6.1/docs/en/upgrade-assistant/index.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>To see the current deprecation logging status, go to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Toggle Deprecation
Logging</strong></span> tab in the Upgrade Assistant. Deprecation Logging is enabled by
default from Elasticsearch 5.x onward. If you have disabled deprecation logging, you
can click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Toggle Deprecation Logging</strong></span> to re-enable it. This logs any
deprecated actions to your log directory so you can see what changes you need
to make to your code before upgrading.</p>
