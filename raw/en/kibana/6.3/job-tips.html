<p>When you are creating a job in Kibana, the job creation wizards can provide
advice based on the characteristics of your data. By heeding these suggestions,
you can create jobs that are more likely to produce insightful machine learning results.</p>

<h3 class="title"><a id="bucket-span"></a>Bucket Span<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/6.3/docs/ml/job-tips.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
</div></div></div>
<p>The bucket span is the time interval that machine learning analytics use to summarize and
model data for your job. When you create a job in Kibana, you can choose to
estimate a bucket span value based on your data characteristics. Typically, the
estimated value is between 5 minutes to 1 hour. If you choose a value that is
larger than one day or is significantly different than the estimated value, you
receive an informational message. For more information about choosing an
appropriate bucket span, see <a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack-overview/6.3/ml-buckets.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Buckets</a>.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>If there are logical groupings of related entities in your data, machine learning analytics
can make data models and generate results that take these groupings into
consideration. For example, you might choose to split your data by user ID and
detect when users are accessing resources differently than they usually do.</p>
<p>If the field that you use to split your data has many different values, the
job uses more memory resources. In particular, if the cardinality of the
<code class="literal">partition_field_name</code> is greater than 100, you are advised to consider
alternative options such as population analysis.</p>
<p>Likewise if you are performing population analysis and the cardinality of the
<code class="literal">over_field_name</code> is below 10, you are advised that this might not be a suitable
field to use.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>When you create a job, you can specify <em>influencers</em>, which are also sometimes
referred to as <em>key fields</em>. Picking an influencer is strongly recommended for
the following reasons:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
It allows you to more easily assign blame for the anomaly
</li>
<li class="listitem">
It simplifies and aggregates the results
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The best influencer is the person or thing that you want to blame for the
anomaly. In many cases, users or client IP addresses make excellent influencers.
Influencers can be any field in your data; they do not need to be fields that
are specified in your detectors, though they often are.</p>
<p>As a best practice, do not pick too many influencers. For example, you generally
do not need more than three. If you pick many influencers, the results can be
overwhelming and there is a small overhead to the analysis.</p>
<p>The job creation wizards in Kibana can suggest which fields to use as influencers.</p>
