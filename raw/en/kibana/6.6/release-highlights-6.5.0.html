<p>Each release of Kibana brings new features and product improvements.
Here are the highlights of the features that were added in 6.5.0 and
how the user experience improved.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a class="xref" href="release-notes-6.5.0.html" title="Kibana 6.5.0">Kibana 6.5.0 Release Notes</a> for a list of bug fixes and
other changes.</p>
<h3><a id="_organize_your_work_in_spaces"></a>Organize your work in spaces<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/6.6/docs/release-notes/highlights-6.5.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><a class="xref" href="xpack-spaces.html" title="Spaces">Spaces</a> is one of our most highly requested features. Spaces allow you to organize
your saved objects into meaningful categories.  For example, you might place all
sales visuals in a sales space and all logging objects in a logging space.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/highlights_6_5_select-space.png" alt="Select your space dashboard">
</div>
</div>
<p>You can create as many spaces as you need, change spaces at any time, and move
saved objects between spaces. With security enabled, you can control which roles
and users have access to which spaces using role-based access control (RBAC).</p>
<p>To create, edit, and delete spaces, use <span class="strong strong"><strong>Management &gt; Spaces</strong></span>.
Or, if you prefer to create your spaces programmatically, you can use the <a class="xref" href="spaces-api.html" title="Kibana Spaces API">Kibana Spaces API</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_monitor_cross_cluster_replication_beta"></a>Monitor cross-cluster replication (beta<sup>*</sup>)<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/6.6/docs/release-notes/highlights-6.5.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Monitoring includes a new UI for monitoring <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.6/ccr-apis.html" class="ulink" target="_top">cross-cluster replication</a> as a beta
feature in 6.5. Cross-cluster replication gives you resiliency in case the primary
cluster fails&#8212;&#8203;a secondary cluster serves as a hot backup. With the UI, you can
monitor how indices are replicated from one cluster to another and view detailed
information on the leader index, the following indices, and the shards.
You’ll also get verification on whether the replication process is viable.</p>

<h3><a id="_showcase_your_data_in_canvas_beta"></a>Showcase your data in Canvas (beta<sup>*</sup>)<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/6.6/docs/release-notes/highlights-6.5.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><a class="xref" href="canvas.html" title="Canvas">Canvas</a> is Kibana’s new place for showcasing your data live in a pixel-perfect design.
Starting with a blank workpad, you can create a story about your data by combining
static content (text, images, and shapes) with data-driven elements (charts, tables,
images, and many others).  Each dynamic element is connected to a sample data
source by default, so you can experiment with it before connecting to your own data.
Canvas supports multiple languages for querying Elasticsearch: es docs, SQL, and Timelion syntax.</p>
<p>Canvas tools have rich styling capabilities, allowing users to change colors and
styles of both static and dynamic elements. Canvas is designed so you can tweak
an element’s content and style using the UI, or go deeper and edit the expressions
that create the element or the css styling. In short, Canvas gives you everything
you need to showcase your live data, your way.</p>

<p>Kibana has a new <a class="xref" href="data-rollups.html" title="Working with rollup indices">Rollup UI</a> for creating, starting, stopping, and deleting rollup
jobs. Rollups is a recent addition to Elasticsearch and <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.6/rollup-apis.html" class="ulink" target="_top">APIs for creating and
managing rollups</a> have been available since 6.4.  A rollup index summarizes historical
data and stores it compactly for future analysis, so you can query, aggregate,
and visualize this data using a fraction of the storage.  A rollup job is a periodic
task that aggregates the data for the rollup index. To navigate to the UI, go to
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Management</strong></span>, and under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Elasticsearch</strong></span>, click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Rollup Jobs</strong></span>.</p>

<h3><a id="_view_rolled_up_data_in_visualizations_beta"></a>View rolled up data in visualizations (beta<sup>*</sup>)<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/6.6/docs/release-notes/highlights-6.5.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Kibana now has <a class="xref" href="visualize-rollup-data.html" title="Create a visualization using rolled up data">beta features for visualizing rolled up data</a>.
You can create index
patterns that use rollup indices or mix rollup and raw indices to visualize all
data together. Most visualizations support rolled up data, with the exception of
Timelion, Visual Builder, and Vega visualizations. You can also create dashboards
that use visualizations based on rolled up and raw data. Finally, both rolled up
and raw data are available in Discover.</p>

<p>The Beats management UI is your one-stop shop for centrally managing your Beats
deployments. This new UI saves you time because you no longer have to log onto the
machine where the Beat is deployed to conduct configuration updates.  From the UI,
you can manage the enrollment of multiple Beats and update their configurations as
a fleet. You must have security enabled to access the Beats UI. This feature is
initially only available for Filebeat and Metricbeat.</p>

<p>Kibana has two new beta features for logging and metrics use cases, Infrastructure
and Logs, both available from the side navigation.  With Infrastructure, you can
explore infrastructure metrics and logs for common servers, containers, and services.</p>

<p>The APM UI now supports distributed tracing as a beta feature in 6.5. Distributed
tracing enables you to analyze and view performance throughout your microservices
architecture by tracing all requests.  These requests range from the initial web
request to your frontend service to queries made to your backend services.
This gives you a trace of how your services interact with one another and enables
you to pinpoint bottlenecks faster.</p>

<h3><a id="_get_started_with_two_new_sample_data_sets"></a>Get started with two new sample data sets<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/6.6/docs/release-notes/highlights-6.5.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Kibana has two new, one-click sample data sets tailored to the new user experience.
If you’re interested in business analytics, install the eCommerce data set, which
has visualizations for product-related information, such as cost, revenue, and price.
If you’re looking to analyze website traffic, check out the web logs sample data set.
To access the sample data, go to the Kibana home page and click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Load a data set and a Kibana dashboard</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Each sample is prepackaged with a dashboard and a Canvas
workpad. The workpad for the eCommerce sample includes two different styles for
the same data. The workpads are a hands-on way for new users to
learn Canvas.</p>

<p>Machine learning features are now available for users on a Basic license. The Data
Visualizer helps you understand the metrics and fields in your data in preparation
for further analysis. With the new File Data Visualizer, you can upload a CSV, NDJSON,
or log file. The File Data Visualizer uses the new File Structure API to identify
the file format and field mappings. You can then choose to import the data into an
Elasticsearch index. The log file import feature is experimental in 6.5, and is
limited to files up to 100 MB in size.</p>
