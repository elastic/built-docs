<p>With so many exciting additions to Kibana, it can be challenging to choose a
path forward. As a result, we have a renewed focus on the initial user experience,
beginning with a new home page.
The new version focuses on core solutions and use cases.</p>

<p>Extending from the home page, you&#8217;re now guided toward solution-focused
landing pages that assist in adding data and introducing underlying capabilities.
These new pages help users, both new and experienced, get started with all that Kibana has to offer.</p>

<p>In 7.8, we introduced a new and improved main menu as part of our
quest for the optimal navigation design.
In 7.10, we reveal more of the picture, with the
addition of a global header that includes a
navigational search.
Using a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+/ on Windows and Linux, Command+/ on MacOS),
you can now jump between applications and saved objects,
including dashboards, visualizations, workpads, saved searches, and more.</p>

<p>To further our commitment to the ongoing journey of making Kibana an incredible
visual data analytics experience for everyone, regardless of technical background, we&#8217;ve made
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Lens</strong></span> generally available. Now users whose companies limit the use of
beta software or services in production can leverage the visualization and analytics
capabilities that <span class="strong strong"><strong>Lens</strong></span> provides.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Lens</strong></span> also introduces two new chart types.
Depending on the type of data you are visualizing, <span class="strong strong"><strong>Lens</strong></span> can now build
percentage bar charts and percentage area charts.</p>

<span class="Admonishment-detail">
This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
</span>
</span> In 7.8, we introduced a dashboard-to-dashboard drilldown that lets you quickly create
custom navigation paths between dashboards, carrying over the filter and
time context. Now you can also create a navigation path from a dashboard to an internal or external
URL.
This functionality is available with a <a href="/subscriptions" class="ulink" target="_top">Gold subscription</a> or higher.
For more information, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.10/drilldowns.html#url-drilldowns" class="ulink" target="_top">URL drilldown documentation</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="maps-enhancements"></a>New ways to act on geospatial data<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.10/docs/user/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Maps and dashboards now work better together.
First, you can use maps with <a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.10/drilldowns.html#dashboard-drilldowns" class="ulink" target="_top">dashboard drilldowns</a>.
Second, when authoring a dashboard, you can create a map, save the map,
and then return to the dashboard in your workflow.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Maps</strong></span> also has new ways to work with your data.  You can now automatically
fit “data to bounds,” keeping your data at the center of attention.
It’s also easier to work with your data if it’s coming from a CSV file. Using the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>File Data Visualizer</strong></span> in <span class="strong strong"><strong>Machine Learning</strong></span>, if you import a CSV file with latitude and longitude fields,
the fields are automatically converted to a <code class="literal">geo_point</code> field.</p>

entities in relation to area of interest boundaries. Also, the new vector
tile rendering enables you to work with more data at faster speeds.</p>

<h3><a id="alerts-new-connectors"></a>New connectors for alerts<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.10/docs/user/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In 7.10, we extended our offering of connectors
by adding the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.10/jira-action-type.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Jira</a> and
<a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.10/resilient-action-type.html" class="ulink" target="_top">IBM Resilient</a> connectors for
use with all alert types. Also,
you can now test if a connector works before using
it with your alerts, so you won&#8217;t lose notifications due to setup errors.</p>

<h3><a id="alerts-rbac"></a>Role-based access control in Alerts and Actions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.10/docs/user/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Alerts and Actions</strong></span> now has role-based access control, so
you can secure alerts based on your organization’s access model. Each
Elastic solution determines access to its own alert types, and users
without access to a solution, will not be able to access its alerts.</p>
<p>A feature control for stack alerts is now included in the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Role</strong></span> definition page. This currently
includes the index threshold alert type, with more stack alerts to follow in future releases.
The <code class="literal">all</code> privilege to stack alerts gives users the
ability to create and edit alerts, and the
<code class="literal">read</code> privilege allows users to view the alerts.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a new feature control for actions and connectors.
The <code class="literal">all</code> privilege enables users to
create and edit connectors, and the
the <code class="literal">read</code> privileges allows users to view connectors and attach actions to alerts.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If you upgrade from a previous version,
any alerts created by a user who does not have access to the
alert types applied in the 7.10 RBAC model, will stop working.
For example, if a user created a metrics-specific alert
without having access to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Observability Metrics</strong></span> application, the alert will stop.
To resume the alert, a user with the correct access must access and save them.</p>

immediate feedback on whether an alert is active (the alerting condition is met),
inactive, or if there is an error and how you can troubleshoot it.</p>

<h3><a id="hiding-management"></a>Hide management based on privileges<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.10/docs/user/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management</strong></span> is home to an ever-growing suite of administrative
tools to help manage your stack. These tools have historically been visible to
all users, even if they weren’t authorized to take advantage of them. Now,
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management</strong></span> only shows the features that users are authorized to use,
based on their assigned <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/security-privileges.html" class="ulink" target="_top">cluster and index privileges</a>.
If a user isn’t authorized
to see any of the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management</strong></span> features, then the entire
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management</strong></span> is hidden.</p>
<p>This highly-requested feature allows administrators to use <a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.10/kibana-privileges.html#kibana-feature-privileges" class="ulink" target="_top">feature privileges</a>
instead of the deprecated Dashboard-only mode,
which will be removed in 8.0. We also updated
<a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.10/management.html" class="ulink" target="_top">our documentation</a> to make
sure the set of required cluster and index privileges are clearly defined
for each <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management</strong></span> feature.</p>
<h3><a id="copy-and-import-objects"></a>Copy and import of saved objects<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.10/docs/user/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>While laying the groundwork for sharing saved objects in multiple spaces,
we overhauled the UI for copying and importing saved objects.
When copying saved objects, you can now create objects, easily resolve conflicts,
and get information on subtotals, object icons, and object titles.
After importing saved objects, you’ll see a summary of the objects created.</p>

<p>Enhancing the functionality for data frame analytics supervised learning,
you can manage the trained models under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Machine Learning</strong></span>. The new tab lists
basic information on each model, with more detailed information displayed on
row expansion, including the inference and job configuration and stats. It also
contains a list of which ingest pipelines make use of each model.
Additional controls allow you to search and delete models, and to view the training
data used to create each model.</p>

<p>Categorization tokenizes a text field, clusters similar data together,
classifies it into categories, and then detects anomalous categories in the data.
Starting in 7.9, per-partition categorization enabled you to do categorization separately
for every value of a partition field. With 7.10, it&#8217;s now possible to configure per-partition
categorization.</p>
<h3><a id="_improved_feature_importance_details_for_data_frame_analytics"></a>Improved feature importance details for data frame analytics<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.10/docs/user/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When you examine the results from your classification or regression machine learning jobs,
you can use feature importance to understand which fields had the biggest impact
on each prediction. In 7.10, you can see the average magnitude of the feature importance
values for each field across all the training data. You can also examine the feature importance values for each individual
prediction in the format of JSON objects or decision plots.</p>
