<p>The Elastic Stack monitoring features provide
<a class="xref" href="alerting-getting-started.html" title="Alerting and Actions">Kibana alerts</a> out-of-the box to notify you of
potential issues in the Elastic Stack. These alerts are preconfigured based on the
best practices recommended by Elastic. However, you can tailor them to meet your
specific needs.</p>
<p>When you open <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Monitoring</strong></span>, the preconfigured Kibana alerts are
created automatically. If you collect monitoring data from multiple clusters,
these alerts can search, detect, and notify on various conditions across the
clusters. The alerts are visible alongside your existing Watcher cluster
alerts. You can view details about the alerts that are active and view health
and performance data for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Beats in real time, as well as
analyze past performance. You can also modify active alerts.</p>

<h3><a id="kibana-alerts-cpu-threshold"></a>CPU threshold<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.12/docs/user/monitoring/kibana-alerts.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>This alert is triggered when a node runs a consistently high CPU load. By
default, the trigger condition is set at 85% or more averaged over the last 5
minutes. The alert is grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by running
checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify interval of 1 day.</p>
<h3><a id="kibana-alerts-disk-usage-threshold"></a>Disk usage threshold<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.12/docs/user/monitoring/kibana-alerts.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>This alert is triggered when a node is nearly at disk capacity. By
default, the trigger condition is set at 80% or more averaged over the last 5
minutes. The alert is grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by running
checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify interval of 1 day.</p>
<h3><a id="kibana-alerts-jvm-memory-threshold"></a>JVM memory threshold<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.12/docs/user/monitoring/kibana-alerts.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>This alert is triggered when a node runs a consistently high JVM memory usage. By
default, the trigger condition is set at 85% or more averaged over the last 5
minutes. The alert is grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by running
checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify interval of 1 day.</p>
<h3><a id="kibana-alerts-missing-monitoring-data"></a>Missing monitoring data<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.12/docs/user/monitoring/kibana-alerts.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>This alert is triggered when any stack products nodes or instances stop sending
monitoring data. By default, the trigger condition is set to missing for 15 minutes
looking back 1 day. The alert is grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by running
checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify interval of 6 hours.</p>
<h3><a id="kibana-alerts-thread-pool-rejections"></a>Thread pool rejections (search/write)<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.12/docs/user/monitoring/kibana-alerts.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>This alert is triggered when a node experiences thread pool rejections. By
default, the trigger condition is set at 300 or more over the last 5
minutes. The alert is grouped across all the nodes of the cluster by running
checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify interval of 1 day.
Thresholds can be set independently for <code class="literal">search</code> and <code class="literal">write</code> type rejections.</p>
<h3><a id="kibana-alerts-ccr-read-exceptions"></a>CCR read exceptions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.12/docs/user/monitoring/kibana-alerts.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>This alert is triggered if a read exception has been detected on any of the
replicated clusters. The trigger condition is met if 1 or more read exceptions
are detected in the last hour. The alert is grouped across all replicated clusters
by running checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify interval of 6 hours.</p>
<h3><a id="kibana-alerts-large-shard-size"></a>Large shard size<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.12/docs/user/monitoring/kibana-alerts.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>This alert is triggered if a large average shard size (across associated primaries) is found on any of the
specified index patterns. The trigger condition is met if an index&#8217;s average shard size is
55gb or higher in the last 5 minutes. The alert is grouped across all indices that match
the default pattern of <code class="literal">*</code> by running checks on a schedule time of 1 minute with a re-notify
interval of 12 hours.</p>
<h3><a id="kibana-alerts-cluster-alerts"></a>Cluster alerts<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.12/docs/user/monitoring/kibana-alerts.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>These alerts summarize the current status of your Elastic Stack. You can drill down into the metrics
to view more information about your cluster and specific nodes, instances, and indices.</p>
<p>An alert will be triggered if any of the following conditions are met within the last minute:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Elasticsearch cluster health status is yellow (missing at least one replica)
or red (missing at least one primary).
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Elasticsearch version mismatch. You have Elasticsearch nodes with
different versions in the same cluster.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Kibana version mismatch. You have Kibana instances with different
versions running against the same Elasticsearch cluster.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Logstash version mismatch. You have Logstash nodes with different
versions reporting stats to the same monitoring cluster.

<li class="listitem">
Elasticsearch nodes changed. You have Elasticsearch nodes that were recently added or removed.

<li class="listitem">
<p>Elasticsearch license expiration. The cluster&#8217;s license is about to expire.</p>
<p>If you do not preserve the data directory when upgrading a Kibana or
Logstash node, the instance is assigned a new persistent UUID and shows up
as a new instance</p>

<li class="listitem">
<p>Subscription license expiration. When the expiration date
approaches, you will get notifications with a severity level relative to how
soon the expiration date is:</p>
