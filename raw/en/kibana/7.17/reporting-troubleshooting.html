<p>Reporting comes with a built-in utility to try to automatically find common issues. When Kibana is running,
navigate to the Report Listing page, and click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Run reporting diagnostics</strong></span>. This will open up a diagnostic tool
that checks various parts of the Kibana deployment and come up with any relevant recommendations.</p>
<p>If the diagnostic information doesn&#8217;t reveal the problem, you can troubleshoot further by starting the Kibana
server with an environment variable for revealing additional debugging logs. Refer to
<a class="xref" href="reporting-troubleshooting.html#reporting-troubleshooting-puppeteer-debug-logs" title="Puppeteer debug logs">Puppeteer debug logs</a>.</p>

<p>If a report label is rendered as an empty rectangle, no system fonts are available. Install at least one font package on the system.</p>
<p>If the report is missing certain Chinese, Japanese or Korean characters, ensure that a system font with those characters is installed.</p>

<p>There is currently a known limitation with the Data Table visualization that only the first page of data rows, which are the only data
visible on the screen, are shown in PDF reports.</p>

<p>Ensure that the <code class="literal">headless_shell</code> binary located in your Kibana data directory is owned by the user who is running Kibana, that the
user has the execute permission, and if applicable, that the filesystem is mounted with the <code class="literal">exec</code> option.</p>

<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="reporting-troubleshooting-error-messages"></a>Error messages</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.17/docs/user/reporting/reporting-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Whenever possible, a Reporting error message tries to be as self-explanatory as possible. Here are some error messages you might encounter,
along with the solution.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="_statuscodeerror_version_conflict_engine_exception"></a><code class="literal">StatusCodeError: [version_conflict_engine_exception]</code></h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.17/docs/user/reporting/reporting-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>If you are running multiple instances of Kibana in a cluster, the instances share the work of executing report jobs to evenly distribute
the work load. Each instance searches the reporting index for "pending" jobs that the user has requested. It is possible for
multiple instances to find the same job in these searches. Only the instance that successfully updated the job status to
"processing" will actually execute the report job. The other instances that unsuccessfully tried to make the same update will log
something similar to this:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-text">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-text">StatusCodeError: [version_conflict_engine_exception] [...]: version conflict, required seqNo [6124], primary term [1]. current document has seqNo [6125] and primary term [1], with { ... }
  status: 409,
  displayName: 'Conflict',
  path: '/.reporting-...',
  body: {
    error: {
      type: 'version_conflict_engine_exception',
      reason: '[...]: version conflict, required seqNo [6124], primary term [1]. current document has seqNo [6125] and primary term [1]',
    },
  },
  statusCode: 409
}</pre>
</div>
<p>These messages alone don&#8217;t indicate a problem. They show normal events that happen in a healthy system.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="_max_attempts_reached"></a>Max attempts reached</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.17/docs/user/reporting/reporting-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>There are two primary causes of this error:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You&#8217;re creating a PDF of a visualization or dashboard that spans a large amount of data and Kibana is hitting the <code class="literal">xpack.reporting.queue.timeout</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Create a Markdown visualization and then create a PDF report. If this succeeds, increase the <code class="literal">xpack.reporting.queue.timeout</code> setting. If the
PDF report fails with "Max attempts reached," check your <a class="xref" href="reporting-settings-kb.html#reporting-kibana-server-settings" title="Kibana server settings">Kibana server settings</a>.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="reporting-troubleshooting-nss-dependency"></a>You must install nss for Reporting to work</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.17/docs/user/reporting/reporting-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Reporting using the Chromium browser relies on the Network Security Service libraries (NSS). Install the appropriate nss package for your
distribution.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="reporting-troubleshooting-sandbox-dependency"></a>Unable to use Chromium sandbox</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.17/docs/user/reporting/reporting-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Chromium uses sandboxing techniques that are built on top of operating system primitives. The Linux sandbox depends on user namespaces,
which were introduced with the 3.8 Linux kernel. However, many distributions don&#8217;t have user namespaces enabled by default, or they require
the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.</p>
<p>Elastic recommends that you research the feasibility of enabling unprivileged user namespaces before disabling the sandbox. An exception
is if you are running Kibana in Docker because the container runs in a user namespace with the built-in seccomp/bpf filters.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="reporting-troubleshooting-verbose-logs"></a>Verbose logs</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.17/docs/user/reporting/reporting-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Kibana server logs have a lot of useful information for troubleshooting and understanding how things work. If you&#8217;re having any issues at
all, the full logs from Reporting will be the first place to look. In <code class="literal">kibana.yml</code>:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">logging:
  appenders:
    console_appender:
      type: console
      layout:
        type: pattern
        highlight: true
  root:
    appenders: [default, console_appender]
    level: debug</pre>
</div>
<p>For more information about logging, see <a class="xref" href="settings.html#logging-root-level">Kibana configuration settings</a>.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="reporting-troubleshooting-puppeteer-debug-logs"></a>Puppeteer debug logs</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.17/docs/user/reporting/reporting-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>The Chromium browser that Kibana launches on the server is driven by a NodeJS library for Chromium called Puppeteer. The Puppeteer library
has its own command-line method to generate its own debug logs, which can sometimes be helpful, particularly to figure out if a problem is
caused by Kibana or Chromium. See more at <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.19.0/README.md#debugging-tips" class="ulink" target="_top">debugging tips</a>.</p>
<p>Using Puppeteer&#8217;s debug method when launching Kibana would look like:</p>
<pre class="screen">env DEBUG="puppeteer:*" ./bin/kibana</pre>
<p>The internal DevTools protocol traffic will be logged via the <code class="literal">debug</code> module under the <code class="literal">puppeteer</code> namespace.</p>
<p>The Puppeteer logs are very verbose and could possibly contain sensitive information. Handle the generated output with care.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="reporting-troubleshooting-system-requirements"></a>System requirements</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.17/docs/user/reporting/reporting-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>In Elastic Cloud, the Kibana instances that most configurations provide by default is for 1GB of RAM for the instance. That is enough for
Kibana Reporting when the visualization or dashboard is relatively simple, such as a single pie chart or a dashboard with
a few visualizations. However, certain visualization types incur more load than others. For example, a TSVB panel has a lot of network
requests to render.</p>
<p>If the Kibana instance doesn&#8217;t have enough memory to run the report, the report fails with an error such as <code class="literal">Error: Page crashed!</code>
In this case, try increasing the memory for the Kibana instance to 2GB.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="reporting-troubleshooting-arm-systems"></a>ARM systems</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.17/docs/user/reporting/reporting-troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Chromium is not compatible with ARM RHEL/CentOS.</p>

<p><a href="/elastic-maps-service" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Maps Service (EMS)</a> is a service that hosts
tile layers and vector shapes of administrative boundaries.
If a report contains a map with a missing basemap layer or administrative boundary, the Kibana server does not have access to EMS.
