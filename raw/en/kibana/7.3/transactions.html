<p>A <a href="/guide/en/apm/get-started/7.0/transactions.html" class="ulink" target="_top">transaction</a> describes an event captured by an Elastic APM agent instrumenting a service.
The APM agents automatically collect performance metrics on HTTP requests, database queries, and much more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Selecting a <a class="xref" href="services.html" title="Services overview"><span class="strong strong"><strong>service</strong></span></a> brings you to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>transactions</strong></span> overview.
The <span class="strong strong"><strong>time spent by span type</strong></span>, <span class="strong strong"><strong>transaction duration</strong></span> and <span class="strong strong"><strong>requests per minute</strong></span> chart display information on all transactions associated with the selected service.
The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Transactions</strong></span> table, however, provides only a list of <em>transaction groups</em> for the selected service.
In other words, this view groups all transactions of the same name together, and only displays one transaction for each group.</p>

</span> Certain agents support breakdown graphs in the APM UI.
This graph is an easy way to visualize where your application is spending most of its time.
For example, is your app spending time in external calls, database processing, or application code execution?</p>
<p>The time a transaction took to complete is also recorded and displayed on the chart under the "app" label.
"app" indicates that something was happening within the application, but we&#8217;re not sure exactly what.
This could be a sign that the agent does not have auto-instrumentation for whatever was happening during that time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that if you have asynchronous spans, the sum of all span times may exceed the duration of the transaction.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Time spent by span type</strong></span> chart is missing in the APM UI, it means your agent does not support this feature yet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Transaction duration</strong></span> shows the response times for this service and is broken down into average, 95th, and 99th percentile.
If there&#8217;s a weird spike that you&#8217;d like to investigate,
you can simply zoom in on the graph - this will adjust the specific time range,
and all of the data on the page will update accordingly.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Requests per minute</strong></span> is divided into response codes: 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, etc.,
and is useful for determining if you&#8217;re serving more of one code than you typically do.
Like in the Transaction duration graph, you can zoom in on anomalies to further investigate them.</p>
<p>The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Transactions</strong></span> table is similar to the <a class="xref" href="traces.html" title="Traces overview">traces</a> overview and shows the name of each transaction occurring in the selected service.
Transactions with the same name are grouped together and only shown once in this table.
By default, transaction groups are sorted by <em>Impact</em>.
Impact helps show the most used and slowest endpoints in your service - in other words,
it&#8217;s the collective amount of pain a specific endpoint is causing your users.
If there&#8217;s a particular endpoint you&#8217;re worried about, you can click on it to view the <a class="xref" href="transactions.html#transaction-details" title="Transaction details">transaction details</a>.</p>

<div class="admon_content">
<p>The transaction overview will only display helpful information when the transactions in your service are named correctly.</p>
<p>Elastic APM Agents come with built-in support for popular frameworks out-of-the-box.
However, if you only see one route in the Transaction overview page, or if you have transactions named "unknown route",
it could be a symptom that the agent either wasn&#8217;t installed correctly or doesn&#8217;t support your framework.</p>

refer to the documentation for each <a href="/guide/en/apm/agent" class="ulink" target="_top">APM Agent</a> you&#8217;ve implemented.</p>

<p>Selecting a transaction group will bring you to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>transaction</strong></span> details.
Transaction details include a high-level overview of the time spent by span type,
transaction group duration, requests per minute, and transaction group duration distribution.
It&#8217;s important to note that all of these graphs show data from every transaction within the selected transaction group.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="apm/images/apm-transaction-response-dist.png" alt="Example view of response time distribution">
</div>
</div>
<p>A single sampled transaction is also displayed.
This sampled transaction is based on your selection in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Transactions duration distribution</strong></span>.
You can update the sampled transaction by selecting a new <em>bucket</em> in the transactions duration distribution graph.
The number of requests per bucket is displayed when hovering over the graph, and the selected bucket is highlighted to stand out.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="apm/images/apm-transaction-duration-dist.png" alt="Example view of transactions duration distribution graph">
</div>
</div>
<p>Most of the requests fall into buckets on the left side of the graph,
with a long tail of smaller buckets to the right.
This is a typical distribution, and indicates most of our requests were served quickly - awesome!
It&#8217;s the requests on the right, the ones taking longer than average, that we probably want to focus on.
By clicking on these buckets,
we&#8217;re presented with a span timeline waterfall showing what a typical request in that bucket was doing.
By investigating this timeline waterfall, we can hopefully see why it was slow and then implement a fix.</p>
