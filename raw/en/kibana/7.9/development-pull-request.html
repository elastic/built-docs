<p>Always submit your pull against master unless the bug is only present in an older version. If the bug affects both master and another branch say so in your pull.</p>
<p>Then sit back and wait. There will probably be discussion about the Pull Request and, if any changes are needed, we&#8217;ll work with you to get your Pull Request merged into Kibana.</p>
