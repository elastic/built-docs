<p>We follow the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/" class="ulink" target="_top">GitHub
forking model</a> for collaborating on Kibana code. This model assumes that
you have a remote called <code class="literal">upstream</code> which points to the official Kibana
repo, which we&#8217;ll refer to in later code snippets.</p>

<p>At Elastic, all products in the stack, including Kibana, are released at the same time with the same version number. Most of these projects have the following branching strategy:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">master</code> is the next major version.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">&lt;major&gt;.x</code> is the next minor version.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</code> is the next release of a minor version, including patch releases.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As an example, let&#8217;s assume that the <code class="literal">7.x</code> branch is currently a not-yet-released <code class="literal">7.6.0</code>. Once <code class="literal">7.6.0</code> has reached feature freeze, it will be branched to <code class="literal">7.6</code> and <code class="literal">7.x</code> will be updated to reflect <code class="literal">7.7.0</code>. The release of <code class="literal">7.6.0</code> and subsequent patch releases will be cut from the <code class="literal">7.6</code> branch. At any time, you can verify the current version of a branch by inspecting the <code class="literal">version</code> attribute in the <code class="literal">package.json</code> file within the Kibana source.</p>
<p>Pull requests are made into the <code class="literal">master</code> branch and then backported when it is safe and appropriate.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Breaking changes do not get backported and only go into <code class="literal">master</code>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
All non-breaking changes can be backported to the <code class="literal">&lt;major&gt;.x</code> branch.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Features should not be backported to a <code class="literal">&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</code> branch.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Bug fixes can be backported to a <code class="literal">&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</code> branch if the changes are safe and appropriate. Safety is a judgment call you make based on factors like the bug&#8217;s severity, test coverage, confidence in the changes, etc. Your reasoning should be included in the pull request description.

<li class="listitem">
Documentation changes can be backported to any branch at any time.

<h5><a id="_rebasing_and_fixing_merge_conflicts"></a>Rebasing and fixing merge conflicts<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/7.x/docs/developer/contributing/development-github.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>Rebasing can be tricky, and fixing merge conflicts can be even trickier
because it involves force pushing. This is all compounded by the fact
that attempting to push a rebased branch remotely will be rejected by
git, and you&#8217;ll be prompted to do a <code class="literal">pull</code>, which is not at all what you
should do (this will really mess up your branch&#8217;s history).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how you should rebase master onto your branch, and how to fix
merge conflicts when they arise.</p>
<p>First, make sure master is up-to-date.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master</pre>
</div>
<p>Then, check out your branch and rebase master on top of it, which will
apply all of the new commits on master to your branch, and then apply
all of your branch&#8217;s new commits after that.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">git checkout name-of-your-branch
git rebase master</pre>
</div>
<p>You want to make sure there are no merge conflicts. If there are merge
conflicts, git will pause the rebase and allow you to fix the conflicts
before continuing.</p>
<p>You can use <code class="literal">git status</code> to see which files contain conflicts. They&#8217;ll
be the ones that aren&#8217;t staged for commit. Open those files, and look
for where git has marked the conflicts. Resolve the conflicts so that
the changes you want to make to the code have been incorporated in a way
that doesn&#8217;t destroy work that&#8217;s been done in master. Refer to master&#8217;s
commit history on GitHub if you need to gain a better understanding of how code is conflicting and how best to resolve it.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve resolved all of the merge conflicts, use <code class="literal">git add -A</code> to stage them to be committed, and then use
 <code class="literal">git rebase --continue</code> to tell git to continue the rebase.</p>
<p>When the rebase has completed, you will need to force push your branch because the history is now completely different than what&#8217;s on the remote. This is potentially dangerous because it will completely overwrite what you have on the remote, so you need to be sure that you haven&#8217;t lost any work when resolving merge conflicts. (If there weren&#8217;t any merge conflicts, then you can force push without having to worry about this.)</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">git push origin name-of-your-branch --force</pre>
</div>
<p>This will overwrite the remote branch with what you have locally. You&#8217;re done!</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Note that you should not run git pull</strong></span>, for example in response to a push rejection like this:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">! [rejected] name-of-your-branch -&gt; name-of-your-branch (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/YourGitHubHandle/kibana.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.</pre>
</div>
<p>Assuming you&#8217;ve successfully rebased and you&#8217;re happy with the code, you should force push instead.</p>
