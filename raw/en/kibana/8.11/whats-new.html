</span> In 8.11 we are introducing <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/esql.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch Query Language (ES|QL)</a>, Elastic’s new piped language for data exploration and investigation. ES|QL transforms, enriches, and simplifies your data exploration process.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">

</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Enrichment:</strong></span> Use the enrich command to enhance your query dataset with fields from another dataset, complete with in-context suggestions for the selected policy, such as hinting the matching field and enriched columns.

<p>You can now edit a <span class="strong strong"><strong>Lens</strong></span> visualization without leaving the dashboard instead of navigating back and forth to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Lens</strong></span> editor. Open the panel menu and select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Edit visualization</strong></span>. A flyout will be open in the dashboard where you can perform any edits to your <span class="strong strong"><strong>Lens</strong></span> panels. Once happy with your edits, click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Apply and close</strong></span>. This new editing experience is more convenient and will save you time since the dashboard will not need to reload when saving your changes.</p>

<p>You can now easily navigate from one dashboard to another using the links panel. Better organize your dashboards and make them more performant by chunking them in multiple dashboards with fewer visualizations and linking them together. You can carry over your filters, query, and time range when navigating to other related dashboards. Display your links horizontally or vertically as it better suits your dashboard layout. You can also use the links panel to include external links in your dashboards, such as to your wiki page or other applications. Decide whether you want to open the links in the same browser tab or in a new one.</p>

<p>Whether you’re working with cartesian, partition, or tag clouds charts, these enhancements are designed to help you make the most of your data.

<p>In 8.8, we introduced Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder in technical preview. ELSER is Elastic’s text expansion language model for AI search. It offers superior relevance out of the box, without the need for retraining on in-domain data or any other ML or MLOps effort. Deploy it with a couple of clicks from Elastic’s UI and start leveraging the power of AI with your search.</p>
<p>In 8.11, we&#8217;re releasing a generally available second version. ELSER model-2 comes in two versions:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The optimized model, which runs on the linux-x86_64 platform
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The cross-platform model
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Both ELSER model-2 versions, platform-optimized and cross-platform, show improved relevance compared to the original ELSER release, as measured against the BEIR benchmarks. Importantly, the optimized version also shows significantly improved performance (reduced inference latency). The Elastic Cloud supports the optimized version and so Elastic Cloud users will benefit from the materially improved performance of the optimized ELSER model-2.</p>

</span>
</span> We are working to introduce a unified inference API that abstracts away the complexity of performing inference on different models that are trained for different tasks. The API introduces a simple, intuitive syntax of the form:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-bash">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-bash">POST /_inference/&lt;task_type&gt;/&lt;model_id&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>In 8.11, we&#8217;re&#8217;releasing a contained first <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.11/inference-apis.html" class="ulink" target="_top">MVP iteration of this framework</a>, which initially only supports ELSER. This <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.11/semantic-search-elser.html#inference-ingest-pipeline" class="ulink" target="_top">greatly simplifies the syntax</a> for creating an inference pipeline.</p>
<p>More importantly, in the future the new inference API will support both internal and external models and will integrate with the LLM ecosystem for our users to have the most powerful AI effortlessly and seamlessly at their fingertips, through a unified, self-explanatory API.</p>

</span>
</span> Continuing enhancing log analysis capabilities with smart AIOps tools for drastically shorter mean time to repair. We now support detection of log rate changes that are due to text fields, for example the common <span class="strong strong"><strong>message</strong></span> log field. Previously log rate change was limited to detecting spikes and dips caused by keyword fields. By adding text fields, we&#8217;ve incorporated pattern analysis into log rate analysis. That has significantly reduced the time it takes to detect and diagnose events that used to go unnoticed for periods of time.</p>

<p>We have improved the UX for attaching anomaly swim lanes and anomaly charts to dashboards. It is now more friendly and consistent with the same functionality from Lens. In addition, you can now attach these ML charts to new dashboards (previously this was only able to be done for existing ones).</p>
<p>In <span class="strong strong"><strong>Data Frame Analytics</strong></span>, we previously added the ability to link directly to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Discover</strong></span> and <span class="strong strong"><strong>Dashboards</strong></span> from the results data grid filtering for the row’s field/values for all visible columns. For improved usability, you can now do this during the job creation as well. We have also made UX improvements for the deployment of trained models from Data Frame Analytics jobs, including an option to reindex your data at the end of the ingest pipeline creation.</p>

<p>A new ES|QL alerting rule type is now available under the existing Elasticsearch rule type. This rule type brings all the new functionalities that are available within the new and powerful language, ES|QL, to Kibana Alerting to allow and unlock new alerting use cases.</p>

<p>A new functionality is now available in Kibana cases. Users will be able to add custom fields to the case structure, so they can use it for better classification and case enrichment.

Before this update, Observability customers who leverage the Elasticsearch rule were required to move between <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management</strong></span> and <span class="strong strong"><strong>Observability</strong></span> to manage their alerts.
To manage the Observability roles properly, we added a new field to determine which role can maintain the created rule and its generated alerts.</p>

You can also access ES|QL in <span class="strong strong"><strong>Discover</strong></span> from the global search bar within Elastic.
