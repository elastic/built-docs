<p>Alerting runs both rule checks and actions as persistent background tasks managed by the Task Manager.</p>
<p>When relying on rules and actions as mission critical services, make sure you follow the <a class="xref" href="task-manager-production-considerations.html" title="Task Manager">production considerations</a> for Task Manager.</p>
<h3><a id="alerting-background-tasks"></a>Running background rule checks and actions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.3/docs/user/production-considerations/alerting-production-considerations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Kibana uses background tasks to run rules and actions, distributed across all Kibana instances in the cluster.</p>
<p>By default, each Kibana instance polls for work at three second intervals, and can run a maximum of ten concurrent tasks.
These tasks are then run on the Kibana server.</p>
<p>Rules are recurring background tasks which are rescheduled according to the <a class="xref" href="create-and-manage-rules.html#defining-rules-general-details" title="General rule details">check interval</a> on completion.
Actions are non-recurring background tasks which are deleted on completion.</p>
<p>For more details on Task Manager, see <a class="xref" href="task-manager-production-considerations.html#task-manager-background-tasks" title="Running background tasks">Running background tasks</a>.</p>

<p>Rule and action tasks can run late or at an inconsistent schedule.
This is typically a symptom of the specific usage of the cluster in question.</p>
<p>You can address such issues by tweaking the <a class="xref" href="task-manager-settings-kb.html#task-manager-settings" title="Task Manager settings">Task Manager settings</a> or scaling the deployment to better suit your use case.</p>

<p>As rules and actions leverage background tasks to perform the majority of work, scaling Alerting is possible by following the <a class="xref" href="task-manager-production-considerations.html#task-manager-scaling-guidance" title="Scaling guidance">Task Manager Scaling Guidance</a>.</p>
<p>When estimating the required task throughput, keep the following in mind:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Each rule uses a single recurring task that is scheduled to run at the cadence defined by its <a class="xref" href="create-and-manage-rules.html#defining-rules-general-details" title="General rule details">check interval</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Each action uses a single task. However, because <a class="xref" href="create-and-manage-rules.html#alerting-concepts-suppressing-duplicate-notifications">actions are taken per instance</a>, alerts can generate a large number of non-recurring tasks.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>It is difficult to predict how much throughput is needed to ensure all rules and actions are executed at consistent schedules.
By counting rules as recurring tasks and actions as non-recurring tasks, a rough throughput <a class="xref" href="task-manager-production-considerations.html#task-manager-rough-throughput-estimation" title="Rough throughput estimation">can be estimated</a> as a <em>tasks per minute</em> measurement.</p>
<p>Predicting the buffer required to account for actions depends heavily on the rule types you use, the amount of alerts they might detect, and the number of actions you might choose to assign to action groups. With that in mind, regularly <a class="xref" href="task-manager-health-monitoring.html" title="Task Manager health monitoring">monitor the health</a> of your Task Manager instances.</p>

<p>This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will apply best effort to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Alerts and actions log activity in a set of "event log" indices.  These indices are configured with an index lifecycle management (ILM) policy, which you can customize.  The default policy rolls over the index when it reaches 50GB, or after 30 days.  Indices over 90 days old are deleted.</p>
<p>The name of the index policy is <code class="literal">kibana-event-log-policy</code>.  Kibana creates the index policy on startup, if it doesn&#8217;t already exist.  The index policy can be customized for your environment, but Kibana never modifies the index policy after creating it.</p>
<p>Because Kibana uses the documents to display historic data, you should set the delete phase longer than you would like the historic data to be shown. For example, if you would like to see one month&#8217;s worth of historic data, you should set the delete phase to at least one month.</p>
<p>For more information on index lifecycle management, see:
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.3/index-lifecycle-management.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Index Lifecycle Policies</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="alerting-circuit-breakers"></a>Circuit breakers<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.3/docs/user/production-considerations/alerting-production-considerations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>There are several scenarios where running alerting rules and actions can start to negatively impact the overall health of a Kibana instance either by clogging up Task Manager throughput or by consuming so much CPU/memory that other operations cannot complete in a reasonable amount of time. There are several <a class="xref" href="alert-action-settings-kb.html#alert-settings" title="Alerting settings">configurable</a> circuit breakers to help minimize these effects.</p>
<h4><a id="_rules_with_very_short_intervals"></a>Rules with very short intervals<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.3/docs/user/production-considerations/alerting-production-considerations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Running large numbers of rules at very short intervals can quickly clog up Task Manager throughput, leading to higher schedule drift. Use <code class="literal">xpack.alerting.rules.minimumScheduleInterval.value</code> to set a minimum schedule interval for rules. The default (and recommended) value for this configuration is <code class="literal">1m</code>. Use <code class="literal">xpack.alerting.rules.minimumScheduleInterval.enforce</code> to specify whether to strictly enforce this minimum. While the default value for this setting is <code class="literal">false</code> to maintain backwards compatibility with existing rules, set this to <code class="literal">true</code> to prevent new and updated rules from running at an interval below the minimum.</p>
<h4><a id="_rules_that_run_for_a_long_time"></a>Rules that run for a long time<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.3/docs/user/production-considerations/alerting-production-considerations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Rules that run for a long time typically do so because they are issuing resource-intensive Elasticsearch queries or performing CPU-intensive processing. This can block the event loop, making Kibana inaccessible while the rule runs. By default, rule processing is cancelled after <code class="literal">5m</code> but this can be overriden using the <code class="literal">xpack.alerting.rules.run.timeout</code> configuration. This value can also be configured per rule type using <code class="literal">xpack.alerting.rules.run.ruleTypeOverrides</code>. For example, the following configuration sets the global timeout value to <code class="literal">1m</code> while allowing <span class="strong strong"><strong>Index Threshold</strong></span> rules to run for <code class="literal">10m</code> before being cancelled.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">xpack.alerting.rules.run:
  timeout: '1m'
  ruleTypeOverrides:
    - id: '.index-threshold'
      timeout: '10m'</pre>
</div>
<p>When a rule run is cancelled, any alerts and actions that were generated during the run are discarded. This behavior is controlled by the <code class="literal">xpack.alerting.cancelAlertsOnRuleTimeout</code> configuration, which defaults to <code class="literal">true</code>. Set this to <code class="literal">false</code> to receive alerts and actions after the timeout, although be aware that these may be incomplete and possibly inaccurate.</p>
<h4><a id="_rules_that_spawn_too_many_actions"></a>Rules that spawn too many actions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.3/docs/user/production-considerations/alerting-production-considerations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Rules that spawn too many actions can quickly clog up Task Manager throughput. This can occur if:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
A rule configured with a single action generates many alerts. For example, if a rule configured to run a single email action generates 100,000 alerts, then 100,000 actions will be scheduled during a run.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
A rule configured with multiple actions generates alerts. For example, if a rule configured to run an email action, a server log action and a webhook action generates 30,000 alerts, then 90,000 actions will be scheduled during a run.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Use <code class="literal">xpack.alerting.rules.run.actions.max</code> to limit the maximum number of actions a rule can generate per run. This value can also be configured by connector type using <code class="literal">xpack.alerting.rules.run.actions.connectorTypeOverrides</code>. For example, the following config sets the global maximum number of actions to 100 while allowing rules with <span class="strong strong"><strong>Email</strong></span> actions to generate up to 200 actions.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">xpack.alerting.rules.run:
  actions:
    max: 100
    connectorTypeOverrides:
      - id: '.email'
        max: 200</pre>
