<p>Many rules must be created within the context of a Kibana app like
<a class="xref" href="observability.html#metrics-app" title="Metrics">Metrics</a>, <a class="xref" href="xpack-apm.html" title="APM">APM</a>, or <a class="xref" href="observability.html#uptime-app" title="Uptime">Uptime</a>, but others
are generic. Generic rule types can be created in <span class="strong strong"><strong>Rules and Connectors</strong></span> by clicking the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Create</strong></span> button. This will launch a flyout that guides you through selecting
a rule type and configuring its conditions and action type. For details on what
types of rules are available and how to configure them, refer to <a class="xref" href="rule-types.html#stack-rules" title="Stack rules">Stack rules</a>.</p>
<p>After a rule is created, you can re-open the flyout and change a rule&#8217;s properties by clicking the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> button shown on each row of the rule listing.</p>

<p>All rules share the following four properties.</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Name
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The name of the rule. While this name does not have to be unique, the name can be referenced in actions and also appears in the searchable rule listing in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Management</strong></span> UI. A distinctive name can help identify and find a rule.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Tags
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A list of tag names that can be applied to a rule. Tags can help you organize and find rules, because tags appear in the rule listing in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Management</strong></span> UI, which is searchable by tag.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Check every
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
This value determines how frequently the rule conditions are checked. Note that the timing of background rule checks is not guaranteed, particularly for intervals of less than 10 seconds. See <a class="xref" href="alerting-production-considerations.html" title="Alerting production considerations">Alerting production considerations</a> for more information.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Notify
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This value limits how often actions are repeated when an alert remains active across rule checks. See <a class="xref" href="create-and-manage-rules.html#alerting-concepts-suppressing-duplicate-notifications">Create and manage rules</a> for more information.<br>
</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">

<a id="alerting-concepts-suppressing-duplicate-notifications"></a>
<p>Since actions are triggered per alert, a rule can end up generating a large number of actions. Take the following example where a rule is monitoring three servers every minute for CPU usage &gt; 0.9, and the rule is set to notify <span class="strong strong"><strong>Every time alert is active</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Minute 1: server X123 &gt; 0.9. <span class="strong strong"><strong>One email</strong></span> is sent for server X123.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Minute 2: X123 and Y456 &gt; 0.9. <span class="strong strong"><strong>Two emails</strong></span> are sent, one for X123 and one for Y456.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Minute 3: X123, Y456, Z789 &gt; 0.9. <span class="strong strong"><strong>Three emails</strong></span> are sent, one for each of X123, Y456, Z789.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In the above example, three emails are sent for server X123 in the span of 3 minutes for the same rule. Often, it&#8217;s desirable to suppress these re-notifications. If you set the rule <span class="strong strong"><strong>Notify</strong></span> setting to <span class="strong strong"><strong>On a custom action interval</strong></span> with an interval of 5 minutes, you reduce noise by only getting emails every 5 minutes for servers that continue to exceed the threshold:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Minute 1: server X123 &gt; 0.9. <span class="strong strong"><strong>One email</strong></span> is sent for server X123.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Minute 2: X123 and Y456 &gt; 0.9. <span class="strong strong"><strong>One email</strong></span> is sent for Y456.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Minute 3: X123, Y456, Z789 &gt; 0.9. <span class="strong strong"><strong>One email</strong></span> is sent for Z789.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To get notified <span class="strong strong"><strong>only once</strong></span> when a server exceeds the threshold, you can set the rule&#8217;s <span class="strong strong"><strong>Notify</strong></span> setting to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Only on status change</strong></span>.</p>

<p>Depending upon the Kibana app and context, you might be prompted to choose the type of rule to create. Some apps will preselect the type of rule for you.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rule-flyout-rule-type-selection.png" alt="Choosing the type of rule to create">
</div>
</div>
<p>Each rule type provides its own way of defining the conditions to detect, but an expression formed by a series of clauses is a common pattern. Each clause has a UI control that allows you to define the clause. For example, in an index threshold rule, the <code class="literal">WHEN</code> clause allows you to select an aggregation operation to apply to a numeric field.</p>

<p>To receive notifications when a rule meets the defined conditions, you must add one or more actions. Start by selecting a type of connector for your action:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rule-flyout-connector-type-selection.png" alt="UI for selecting an action type">
</div>
</div>
<p>Each action must specify a <a class="xref" href="alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-concepts-connectors" title="Connectors">connector</a> instance. If no connectors exist for the selected type, click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Add connector</strong></span> to create one.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rule-flyout-action-no-connector.png" alt="UI for adding connector">
</div>
</div>
<p>Once you have selected a connector, use the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Run When</strong></span> dropdown to choose the action group to associate with this action. When a rule meets the defined condition, it is marked as <span class="strong strong"><strong>Active</strong></span> and alerts are created and assigned to an action group. In addition to the action groups defined by the selected rule type, each rule also has a <span class="strong strong"><strong>Recovered</strong></span> action group that is assigned when a rule&#8217;s conditions are no longer detected.</p>
<p>Each action type exposes different properties. For example, an email action allows you to set the recipients, the subject, and a message body in markdown format. See <a class="xref" href="action-types.html" title="Connectors"><em>Connectors</em></a> for details on the types of actions provided by Kibana and their properties.</p>

<img src="images/rule-flyout-action-variables.png" alt="Passing rule values to an action">
</div>
</div>
<p>Some cases exist where the variable values will be "escaped", when used in a context where escaping is needed:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
For the <a class="xref" href="email-action-type.html" title="Email connector and action">Email</a> connector, the <code class="literal">message</code> action configuration property escapes any characters that would be interpreted as Markdown.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
For the <a class="xref" href="slack-action-type.html" title="Slack connector and action">Slack</a> connector, the <code class="literal">message</code> action configuration property escapes any characters that would be interpreted as Slack Markdown.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
For the <a class="xref" href="webhook-action-type.html" title="Webhook connector and action">Webhook</a> connector, the <code class="literal">body</code> action configuration property escapes any characters that are invalid in JSON string values.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Mustache also supports "triple braces" of the form <code class="literal">{{{variable name}}}</code>, which indicates no escaping should be done at all.  Care should be used when using this form, as it could end up rendering the variable content in such a way as to make the resulting parameter invalid or formatted incorrectly.</p>
<p>Each rule type defines additional variables as properties of the variable <code class="literal">context</code>.  For example, if a rule type defines a variable <code class="literal">value</code>, it can be used in an action parameter as <code class="literal">{{context.value}}</code>.</p>
<p>For diagnostic or exploratory purposes, action variables whose values are objects, such as <code class="literal">context</code>, can be referenced directly as variables.  The resulting value will be a JSON representation of the object.  For example, if an action parameter includes <code class="literal">{{context}}</code>, it will expand to the JSON representation of all the variables and values provided by the rule type.</p>
<p>You can attach more than one action. Clicking the "Add action" button will prompt you to select another rule type and repeat the above steps again.</p>

<p>Select a rule name from the rule listing to access the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Rule details</strong></span> page, which tells you about the state of the rule and provides granular control over the actions it is taking.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rule-details-alerts-active.png" alt="Rule details page with three alerts">
</div>
</div>
<p>In this example, the rule detects when a site serves more than a threshold number of bytes in a 24 hour period. Three sites are above the threshold. These are called alerts - occurrences of the condition being detected - and the alert name, status, time of detection, and duration of the condition are shown in this view.</p>
<p>Upon detection, each alert can trigger one or more actions. If the condition persists, the same actions will trigger either on the next scheduled rule check, or (if defined) after the re-notify period on the rule has passed. To prevent re-notification, you can suppress future actions by clicking on the switch to mute an individual alert.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rule-details-alert-muting.png" alt="Muting an alert" width="50%">
</div>
</div>
<p>Alerts will come and go from the list depending on whether they meet the rule conditions or not - unless they are muted. If a muted instance no longer meets the rule conditions, it will appear as inactive in the list. This prevents an alert from triggering actions if it reappears in the future.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rule-details-alerts-inactive.png" alt="Rule details page with three inactive alerts">

<p>If you want to suppress actions on all current and future alerts, you can mute the entire rule. Rule checks continue to run and the alert list will update as alerts activate or deactivate, but no actions will be triggered.</p>
