<h2><a id="_concepts_and_terminology"></a>Concepts and terminology<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.5/docs/user/alerting/alerting-getting-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>Alerting works by running checks on a schedule to detect conditions defined by a <span class="strong strong"><strong>rule</strong></span>. When a condition is met, the rule tracks it as an <span class="strong strong"><strong>alert</strong></span> and responds by triggering one or more <span class="strong strong"><strong>actions</strong></span>.
Actions typically involve interaction with Kibana services or third party integrations. <span class="strong strong"><strong>Connectors</strong></span> allow actions to talk to these services and integrations.
This section describes all of these elements and how they operate together.</p>
<h3><a id="_rules"></a>Rules<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.5/docs/user/alerting/alerting-getting-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>A rule specifies a background task that runs on the Kibana server to check for specific conditions. Kibana provides two types of rules: stack rules that are built into Kibana and the rules that are registered by Kibana apps. Refer to <a class="xref" href="rule-types.html" title="Rule types">Rule types</a> for more information.</p>
<p>A rule consists of three main parts:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Conditions</strong></span>: what needs to be detected?
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Schedule</strong></span>: when/how often should detection checks run?
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Actions</strong></span>: what happens when a condition is detected?
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For example, when monitoring a set of servers, a rule might:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Check for average CPU usage &gt; 0.9 on each server for the last two minutes (condition).
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check every minute (schedule).
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Send a warning email message via SMTP with subject <code class="literal">CPU on {{server}} is high</code> (action).
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/what-is-a-rule.svg" alt="Three components of a rule">
</div>
</div>
<p>The following sections describe each part of the rule in more detail.</p>
<h4><a id="alerting-concepts-conditions"></a>Conditions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.5/docs/user/alerting/alerting-getting-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Under the hood, Kibana rules detect conditions by running a JavaScript function on the Kibana server, which gives it the flexibility to support a wide range of conditions, anything from the results of a simple Elasticsearch query to heavy computations involving data from multiple sources or external systems.</p>
<p>These conditions are packaged and exposed as <span class="strong strong"><strong>rule types</strong></span>. A rule type hides the underlying details of the condition, and exposes a set of parameters
to control the details of the conditions to detect.</p>
<p>For example, an <a class="xref" href="rule-type-index-threshold.html" title="Index threshold">index threshold rule type</a> lets you specify the index to query, an aggregation field, and a time window, but the details of the underlying Elasticsearch query are hidden.</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="rule-types.html" title="Rule types"><em>Rule types</em></a> for the rules provided by Kibana and how they express their conditions.</p>
<h4><a id="alerting-concepts-scheduling"></a>Schedule<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.5/docs/user/alerting/alerting-getting-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Rule schedules are defined as an interval between subsequent checks, and can range from a few seconds to months.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The intervals of rule checks in Kibana are approximate. Their timing is affected by factors such as the frequency at which tasks are claimed and the task load on the system. Refer to <a class="xref" href="alerting-production-considerations.html" title="Alerting production considerations"><em>Alerting</em></a> for more information.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4><a id="alerting-concepts-actions"></a>Actions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.5/docs/user/alerting/alerting-getting-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Actions are invocations of connectors, which allow interaction with Kibana services or integrations with third-party systems. Actions run as background tasks on the Kibana server when rule conditions are met.</p>
<p>When defining actions in a rule, you specify:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The <span class="strong strong"><strong>connector type</strong></span>: the type of service or integration to use
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The connection for that type by referencing a <a class="xref" href="alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-concepts-connectors" title="Connectors">connector</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
A mapping of rule values to properties exposed for that type of action
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The result is a template: all the parameters needed to invoke a service are supplied except for specific values that are only known at the time the rule condition is detected.</p>
<p>In the server monitoring example, the <code class="literal">email</code> connector type is used, and <code class="literal">server</code> is mapped to the body of the email, using the template string <code class="literal">CPU on {{server}} is high</code>.</p>
<p>When the rule detects the condition, it creates an <a class="xref" href="alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-concepts-alerts" title="Alerts">alert</a> containing the details of the condition, renders the template with these details such as server name, and runs the action on the Kibana server by invoking the <code class="literal">email</code> connector type.</p>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
</div>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="action-types.html" title="Connectors"><em>Connectors</em></a> for details on the types of connectors provided by Kibana.</p>
<h3><a id="alerting-concepts-alerts"></a>Alerts<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.5/docs/user/alerting/alerting-getting-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When checking for a condition, a rule might identify multiple occurrences of the condition. Kibana tracks each of these <span class="strong strong"><strong>alerts</strong></span> separately and takes an action per alert.</p>
<p>Using the server monitoring example, each server with average CPU &gt; 0.9 is tracked as an alert. This means a separate email is sent for each server that exceeds the threshold.</p>

<h3><a id="alerting-concepts-connectors"></a>Connectors<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.5/docs/user/alerting/alerting-getting-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Actions often involve connecting with services inside Kibana or integrating with third-party systems.
Rather than repeatedly entering connection information and credentials for each action, Kibana simplifies action setup using <span class="strong strong"><strong>connectors</strong></span>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Connectors</strong></span> provide a central place to store connection information for services and integrations. For example if four rules send email notifications via the same SMTP service, they can all reference the same SMTP connector. When the SMTP settings change, you can update them once in the connector, instead of having to update four rules.</p>

<h2><a id="_putting_it_all_together"></a>Putting it all together<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.5/docs/user/alerting/alerting-getting-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>A <span class="strong strong"><strong>rule</strong></span> consists of conditions, <span class="strong strong"><strong>actions</strong></span>, and a schedule. When conditions are met, <span class="strong strong"><strong>alerts</strong></span> are created that render <span class="strong strong"><strong>actions</strong></span> and invoke them. To make action setup and update easier, actions use <span class="strong strong"><strong>connectors</strong></span> that centralize the information used to connect with Kibana services and third-party integrations. The following example ties these concepts together:</p>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rule-concepts-summary.svg" alt="Rules" width="connectors" height="alerts and actions work together to convert detection into action">
</div>
</div>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Anytime a <span class="strong strong"><strong>rule</strong></span>'s conditions are met, an <span class="strong strong"><strong>alert</strong></span> is created.  This example checks for servers with average CPU &gt; 0.9. Three servers meet the condition, so three alerts are created.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Alerts create <span class="strong strong"><strong>actions</strong></span> as long as they are not muted or throttled. When actions are created, the template that was setup in the rule is filled with actual values. In this example, three actions are created, and the template string {{server}} is replaced with the server name for each alert.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Kibana invokes the actions, sending them to a third party <span class="strong strong"><strong>integration</strong></span> like an email service.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If the third party integration has connection parameters or credentials, Kibana will fetch these from the <span class="strong strong"><strong>connector</strong></span> referenced in the action.
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="alerting-concepts-differences"></a>Differences from Watcher<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.5/docs/user/alerting/alerting-getting-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>Alerting and <a class="xref" href="watcher-ui.html" title="Watcher">Watcher</a> are both used to detect conditions and can trigger actions in response, but they are completely independent alerting systems.</p>
<p>This section will clarify some of the important differences in the function and intent of the two systems.</p>
<p>Functionally, Alerting differs in that:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Scheduled checks are run on Kibana instead of Elasticsearch
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Kibana <a class="xref" href="alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-concepts-conditions" title="Conditions">rules hide the details of detecting conditions</a> through <span class="strong strong"><strong>rule types</strong></span>, whereas watches provide low-level control over inputs, conditions, and transformations.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Kibana rules track and persist the state of each detected condition through <span class="strong strong"><strong>alerts</strong></span>. This makes it possible to mute and throttle individual alerts, and detect changes in state such as resolution.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Actions are linked to <span class="strong strong"><strong>alerts</strong></span> in Alerting. Actions are fired for each occurrence of a detected condition, rather than for the entire rule.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>At a higher level, Alerting allows rich integrations across use cases like <a class="xref" href="xpack-apm.html" title="APM"><span class="strong strong"><strong>APM</strong></span></a>, <a class="xref" href="observability.html#metrics-app" title="Metrics"><span class="strong strong"><strong>Metrics</strong></span></a>, <a class="xref" href="xpack-siem.html" title="Elastic Security overview"><span class="strong strong"><strong>Security</strong></span></a>, and <a class="xref" href="observability.html#uptime-app" title="Uptime"><span class="strong strong"><strong>Uptime</strong></span></a>.
Prepackaged <span class="strong strong"><strong>rule types</strong></span> simplify setup and hide the details of complex, domain-specific detections, while providing a consistent interface across Kibana.</p>
