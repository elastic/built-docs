<p>Alerting rules can use the <a href="https://mustache.github.io/" class="ulink" target="_top">Mustache</a> template syntax
(<code class="literal">{{variable name}}</code>) to pass values when its actions run.</p>
<p>The available variables differ by rule type, however there are some common variables:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="rule-action-variables.html#general-rule-action-variables" title="General">General</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="rule-action-variables.html#alert-summary-action-variables" title="Action frequency: Summary of alerts">Action frequency: Summary of alerts</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="rule-action-variables.html#alert-action-variables" title="Action frequency: For each alert">Action frequency: For each alert</a>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Some cases exist where the variable values will be "escaped" when used in a context where escaping is needed. For example:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
For the <a class="xref" href="email-action-type.html" title="Email connector and action">email connector</a>, the <code class="literal">message</code> action configuration property escapes any characters that would be interpreted as Markdown.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
For the <a class="xref" href="slack-action-type.html" title="Slack connector and action">Slack connector</a>, the <code class="literal">message</code> action configuration property escapes any characters that would be interpreted as Slack Markdown.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
For the <a class="xref" href="webhook-action-type.html" title="Webhook connector and action">Webhook connector</a>, the <code class="literal">body</code> action configuration property escapes any characters that are invalid in JSON string values.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Mustache also supports "triple braces" of the form <code class="literal">{{{variable name}}}</code>, which indicates no escaping should be done at all. Use this form with caution, since it could end up rendering the variable content such that the resulting parameter is invalid or formatted incorrectly.</p>

<p>If the rule&#8217;s action frequency is not a summary of alerts, the rule defines additional variables as properties of the variable <code class="literal">context</code>. For example, if a rule type defines a variable <code class="literal">value</code>, it can be used in an action parameter as <code class="literal">{{context.value}}</code>.</p>
<p>For diagnostic or exploratory purposes, action variables whose values are objects, such as <code class="literal">context</code>, can be referenced directly as variables. The resulting value will be a JSON representation of the object. For example, if an action parameter includes <code class="literal">{{context}}</code>, it will expand to the JSON representation of all the variables and values provided by the rule type. To see alert-specific variables, use <code class="literal">{{.}}</code>.</p>
<p>For situations where your rule response returns arrays of data, you can loop through the <code class="literal">context</code>:</p>
<pre class="screen">{{#context}}{{.}}{{/context}}</pre>
<p>For example, looping through search result hits:</p>
<pre class="screen">triggering data was:
{{#context.hits}} - {{_source.message}}
{{/context.hits}}</pre>
