<p>Explain log rate spikes is a feature that uses advanced statistical methods to
identify reasons for increases in log rates. It makes it easy to find and
investigate causes of unusual spikes by using the analysis workflow view.
Examine the histogram chart of the log rates for a given data view, and find
the reason behind a particular change possibly in millions of log events across
multiple fields and values.</p>
<p>You can find explain log rate spikes under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Machine Learning</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong strong"><strong>AIOps Labs</strong></span> where
you can select the data view or saved search that you want to analyze.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Select a spike in the log event histogram chart to start the analysis. It
identifies statistically significant field-value combinations that contribute to
the spike and displays them in a table. You can optionally choose to summarize
the results into groups. The table also shows an indicator of the level of
impact and a sparkline showing the shape of the impact in the chart. Hovering
over a row displays the impact on the histogram chart in more detail. You can
inspect a field in <span class="strong strong"><strong>Discover</strong></span>, further investigate in <span class="strong strong"><strong>Log pattern analysis</strong></span>,
or copy the table row information as a query filter to the clipboard by
selecting the corresponding option under the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Actions</strong></span> column. You can also
pin a table row by clicking on it then move the cursor to the histogram chart.
It displays a tooltip with exact count values for the pinned field which enables
closer investigation.</p>
<p>Brushes in the chart show the baseline time range and the deviation in the
analyzed data. You can move the brushes to redefine both the baseline and the
deviation and rerun the analysis with the modified values.</p>

<p>Log pattern analysis helps you to find patterns in unstructured log messages and
makes it easier to examine your data. It performs categorization analysis on a
selected field of a data view, creates categories based on the data and
displays them together with a chart that shows the distribution of each category
and an example document that matches the category.</p>
<p>You can find log pattern analysis under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Machine Learning</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong strong"><strong>AIOps Labs</strong></span> where you
can select the data view or saved search that you want to analyze, or in
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Discover</strong></span> as an available action for any text field.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Select a field for categorization and optionally apply any filters that you
want, then start the analysis. The analysis uses the same algorithms as a machine learning
categorization job. The results of the analysis are shown in a table that makes
it possible to open <span class="strong strong"><strong>Discover</strong></span> and show or filter out the given category
there, which helps you to further examine your log messages.</p>

</div>
<p>Change point detection uses the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.9/search-aggregations-change-point-aggregation.html" class="ulink" target="_top">change point aggregation</a>
to detect distribution changes, trend changes, and other statistically
significant change points in a metric of your time series data.</p>
<p>You can find change point detection under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Machine Learning</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong strong"><strong>AIOps Labs</strong></span> where
you can select the data view or saved search that you want to analyze.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="user/ml/images/ml-change-point-detection.png" alt="Change point detection UI">
</div>
</div>
<p>Select a function and a metric field, then pick a date range to start detecting
change points in the defined range. Optionally, you can split the data by a
field. If the cardinality of the split field exceeds 10,000, then only the first
10,000, sorted by document count, are analyzed. You can configure a maximum of 6
combinations of a function applied to a metric field, partitioned by a split
field to identify change points.</p>
<p>When a change point is detected, a row displays basic information including the
timestamp of the change point, a preview chart, the type of change point, its
p-value, the name and value of the split field. You can further examine the
selected change point in a detailed view. A chart visualizes the identified
change point within the analyzed time window, making the interpretation easier.
If the analysis is split by a field, a separate chart is shown for every
partition that has a detected change point. The chart displays the type of
change point, its value, and the timestamp of the bucket where the change point
has been detected. The corresponding <code class="literal">p-value</code> indicates the magnitude of the
change; lower values indicate more significant changes. You can use the change
point type selector to filter the results by specific types of change points.</p>
