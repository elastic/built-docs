<p>When the conditions of a rule are met, it creates an alert.
If the rule has actions, they run at the defined frequency.
For example, the rule can send email notifications for each alert at a custom interval.
For an introduction to the concepts of rules, alerts, and actions, refer to <a class="xref" href="alerting-getting-started.html" title="Alerting">Alerting</a>.</p>
<p>You can manage the alerts for each rule in <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong strong"><strong>Rules</strong></span>.
Alternatively, manage all your alerts in <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alerts</strong></span>. <span class="Admonishment Admonishment--preview">

<p>In <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management</strong></span> &gt; <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alerts</strong></span>, you can filter the list (for example, by alert status or rule type) and customize the filter controls.
To search for specific alerts, use the KQL bar to create structured queries using <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.19/kuery-query.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana Query Language</a>.</p>
<p>By default, the list contains all the alerts that you have authority to view in the selected time period except those associated with Security rules.
To view alerts for Security rules, click the query menu and select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Security rule types</strong></span>:</p>

<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="view-alert-details"></a>View alert details</h3><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.19/docs/user/alerting/view-alerts.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>To get more information about a specific alert, open its action menu (…) and select <span class="strong strong"><strong>View alert details</strong></span> in either <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management &gt; Alerts</strong></span> or <span class="strong strong"><strong>Rules</strong></span>.
There you&#8217;ll see the current status of the alert, its duration, and when it was last updated.
To help you determine what caused the alert, there is information such as the expected and actual threshold values and a summarized reason for the alert.</p>
<p>If an alert is affected by a maintenance window, the alert details include its identifier.
For more information about their impact on alert notifications, refer to <a class="xref" href="maintenance-windows.html" title="Maintenance windows"><em>Maintenance windows</em></a>.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="alert-status"></a>Alert statuses</h3><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.19/docs/user/alerting/view-alerts.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>There are four common alert statuses:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">active</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The conditions for the rule are met. If the rule has  <a class="xref" href="create-and-manage-rules.html#defining-rules-actions-details" title="Actions">actions</a>, Kibana generates notifications based on the actions' notification settings.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">flapping</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The alert is switching repeatedly between active and recovered states. If the rule has actions that run when the alert status changes states, those actions are suppressed while the alert is flapping.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Alert flapping is turned on by default. You can modify the criteria for changing an alert&#8217;s status to the flapping state by configuring the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alert flapping detection</strong></span> settings. To do this, navigate to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alerts</strong></span> page in the main menu, or use the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.19/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search" class="ulink" target="_top">global search field</a>. Next, click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Manage Rules</strong></span>, then <span class="strong strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> to open the global rule settings for the space. In the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alert flapping detection</strong></span> section, modify the rules' look back window and threshold for alert status changes. For example, you can specify that the alert must change its status at least 6 times in the last 10 runs for it to become a flapping alert.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">recovered</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The conditions for the rule are no longer met. If the rule has  <a class="xref" href="create-and-manage-rules.html#defining-rules-actions-details" title="Actions">recovery actions</a>, Kibana generates notifications based on the actions' notification settings. Recovery actions only run if the rule&#8217;s conditions aren&#8217;t met during the current rule execution, but were in the previous one.
</p>
<p>An active alert changes to recovered if the conditions for the rule that generated it are no longer met.</p>
<p>A flapping alert changes to recovered when the rule&#8217;s conditions are unmet for a specific number of consecutive runs. This number is determined by the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alert status change threshold</strong></span> setting, which you can configure under the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alert flapping detection</strong></span> settings.</p>
<p>For example, if the threshold requires an alert to change status at least 6 times in the last 10 runs to be considered flapping, then to recover, the rule&#8217;s conditions must remain unmet for 6 consecutive runs. If the rule&#8217;s conditions are met at any point during this recovery period, the count of consecutive unmet runs will reset, requiring the alert to remain unmet for an additional 6 consecutive runs to finally be reported as recovered.</p>
<p>Once a flapping alert is recovered, it cannot be changed to flapping again. Only new alerts with repeated status changes are candidates for the flapping status.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">untracked</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The rule is disabled, or you&#8217;ve marked the alert as untracked. To mark the alert as untracked, go to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alerts</strong></span> table, click the actions icon (…) to expand the <span class="strong strong"><strong>More actions</strong></span> menu, and click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Mark as untracked</strong></span>. When an alert is marked as untracked, actions are no longer generated and the alert&#8217;s status can no longer be changed. You can choose to move active alerts to this state when you disable or delete rules.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="mute-alerts"></a>Mute alerts</h3><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/8.19/docs/user/alerting/view-alerts.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>If an alert is active or flapping, you can mute it to temporarily suppress future actions. In <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management &gt; Alerts</strong></span>, open the action menu (…) for the appropriate alert, then select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Mute</strong></span>. While muted, the alert&#8217;s status will continue to update but rule actions won&#8217;t run. All future alerts with the same alert ID will also be muted.</p>
<p>To permanently suppress an alert&#8217;s actions, open the actions menu for the appropriate alert, then select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Mark as untracked</strong></span>. In this case, the alert&#8217;s status is no longer updated and actions are no longer run. These changes are only applied to the alert that you untracked and cannot be reverted. Future alerts with the same alert ID are unaffected.</p>
