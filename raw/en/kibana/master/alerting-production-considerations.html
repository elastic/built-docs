<p>Alerting runs both rule checks and actions as persistent background tasks managed by the Task Manager.</p>
<p>When relying on rules and actions as mission critical services, make sure you follow the <a class="xref" href="task-manager-production-considerations.html" title="Task Manager">production considerations</a> for Task Manager.</p>
<h3><a id="alerting-background-tasks"></a>Running background rule checks and actions<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/master/docs/user/production-considerations/alerting-production-considerations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Kibana uses background tasks to run rules and actions, distributed across all Kibana instances in the cluster.</p>
<p>By default, each Kibana instance polls for work at three second intervals, and can run a maximum of ten concurrent tasks.
These tasks are then run on the Kibana server.</p>
<p>Rules are recurring background tasks which are rescheduled according to the <a class="xref" href="defining-alerts.html#defining-alerts-general-details" title="General rule details">check interval</a> on completion.
Actions are non-recurring background tasks which are deleted on completion.</p>
<p>For more details on Task Manager, see <a class="xref" href="task-manager-production-considerations.html#task-manager-background-tasks" title="Running background tasks">Running background tasks</a>.</p>

<p>Rule and action tasks can run late or at an inconsistent schedule.
This is typically a symptom of the specific usage of the cluster in question.</p>
<p>You can address such issues by tweaking the <a class="xref" href="task-manager-settings-kb.html#task-manager-settings" title="Task Manager settings">Task Manager settings</a> or scaling the deployment to better suit your use case.</p>

<h3><a id="alerting-scaling-guidance"></a>Scaling Guidance<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/edit/master/docs/user/production-considerations/alerting-production-considerations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>As rules and actions leverage background tasks to perform the majority of work, scaling Alerting is possible by following the <a class="xref" href="task-manager-production-considerations.html#task-manager-scaling-guidance" title="Scaling guidance">Task Manager Scaling Guidance</a>.</p>
<p>When estimating the required task throughput, keep the following in mind:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Each rule uses a single recurring task that is scheduled to run at the cadence defined by its <a class="xref" href="defining-alerts.html#defining-alerts-general-details" title="General rule details">check interval</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Each action uses a single task. However, because <a class="xref" href="alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-concepts-suppressing-duplicate-notifications" title="Suppressing duplicate notifications">actions are taken per instance</a>, alerts can generate a large number of non-recurring tasks.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>It is difficult to predict how much throughput is needed to ensure all rules and actions are executed at consistent schedules.
By counting rules as recurring tasks and actions as non-recurring tasks, a rough throughput <a class="xref" href="task-manager-production-considerations.html#task-manager-rough-throughput-estimation" title="Rough throughput estimation">can be estimated</a> as a <em>tasks per minute</em> measurement.</p>
<p>Predicting the buffer required to account for actions depends heavily on the rule types you use, the amount of alerts they might detect, and the number of actions you might choose to assign to action groups. With that in mind, regularly <a class="xref" href="task-manager-health-monitoring.html" title="Task Manager health monitoring">monitor the health</a> of your Task Manager instances.</p>
