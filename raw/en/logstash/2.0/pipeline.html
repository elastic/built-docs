<p>The Logstash event processing pipeline has three stages: inputs &#8594; filters &#8594;
outputs. Inputs generate events, filters modify them, and outputs ship them
elsewhere. Inputs and outputs support codecs that enable you to encode or decode
the data as it enters or exits the pipeline without having to use a separate
filter.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="_inputs"></a>Inputs</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/logstash/edit/master/docs/asciidoc/static/life-of-an-event.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>You use inputs to get data into Logstash. Some of the more commonly-used inputs
are:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>file</strong></span>: reads from a file on the filesystem, much like the UNIX command
<code class="literal">tail -0F</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>syslog</strong></span>: listens on the well-known port 514 for syslog messages and parses
according to the RFC3164 format
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>redis</strong></span>: reads from a redis server, using both redis channels and redis lists.
Redis is often used as a "broker" in a centralized Logstash installation, which
queues Logstash events from remote Logstash "shippers".
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>beats</strong></span>: processes events sent by <a href="/downloads/beats/filebeat" class="ulink" target="_top">Filebeat</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For more information about the available inputs, see
<a class="xref" href="input-plugins.html" title="Input plugins">Input Plugins</a>.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="_filters"></a>Filters</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/logstash/edit/master/docs/asciidoc/static/life-of-an-event.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Filters are intermediary processing devices in the Logstash pipeline. You can
combine filters with conditionals to perform an action on an event if it meets
certain criteria. Some useful filters include:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>grok</strong></span>: parse and structure arbitrary text. Grok is currently the best way in
Logstash to parse unstructured log data into something structured and queryable.
With 120 patterns built-in to Logstash, it&#8217;s more than likely you&#8217;ll find one
that meets your needs!
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>mutate</strong></span>: perform general transformations on event fields. You can rename,
remove, replace, and modify fields in your events.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>drop</strong></span>: drop an event completely, for example, <em>debug</em> events.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>clone</strong></span>: make a copy of an event, possibly adding or removing fields.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>geoip</strong></span>: add information about geographical location of IP addresses (also
displays amazing charts in Kibana!)
</li>
</ul>

<p>Outputs are the final phase of the Logstash pipeline. An event can pass through
multiple outputs, but once all output processing is complete, the event has
finished its execution. Some commonly used outputs include:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>elasticsearch</strong></span>: send event data to Elasticsearch. If you&#8217;re planning to save
your data in an efficient, convenient, and easily queryable format&#8230;&#8203;
Elasticsearch is the way to go. Period. Yes, we&#8217;re biased :)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>file</strong></span>: write event data to a file on disk.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>graphite</strong></span>: send event data to graphite, a popular open source tool for
storing and graphing metrics. <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/" class="ulink" target="_top">http://graphite.wikidot.com/</a>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>statsd</strong></span>: send event data to statsd, a service that "listens for statistics,
like counters and timers, sent over UDP and sends aggregates to one or more
pluggable backend services". If you&#8217;re already using statsd, this could be
useful for you!
</li>
</ul>

<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="_codecs"></a>Codecs</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/logstash/edit/master/docs/asciidoc/static/life-of-an-event.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Codecs are basically stream filters that can operate as part of an input or
output. Codecs enable you to easily separate the transport of your messages from
the serialization process. Popular codecs include <code class="literal">json</code>, <code class="literal">msgpack</code>, and <code class="literal">plain</code>
(text).</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>json</strong></span>: encode or decode data in the JSON format.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>multiline</strong></span>: merge multiple-line text events such as java exception and
stacktrace messages into a single event.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="_fault_tolerance"></a>Fault Tolerance</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/logstash/edit/master/docs/asciidoc/static/life-of-an-event.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Events are passed from stage to stage using internal queues implemented with a
Ruby <code class="literal">SizedQueue</code>. A <code class="literal">SizedQueue</code> has a maximum number of items it can contain.
When the queue is at maximum capacity, all writes to the queue are blocked.</p>
<p>Logstash sets the size of each queue to 20. This means a maximum of 20 events
can be pending for the next stage, which helps prevent data loss and keeps
Logstash from acting as a data storage system. These internal queues are not
intended for storing messages long-term.</p>
<p>The small queue sizes mean that Logstash simply blocks and stalls safely when
there&#8217;s a heavy load or temporary pipeline problems. The alternatives would be
to either have an unlimited queue or drop messages when there&#8217;s a problem. An
unlimited queue can grow unbounded and eventually exceed memory, causing a crash
that loses all of the queued messages. In most cases, dropping messages outright
is equally undesirable.</p>
<p>An output can fail or have problems due to downstream issues, such as a full
disk, permissions problems, temporary network failures, or service outages. Most
outputs keep retrying to ship events affected by the failure.</p>
<p>If an output is failing, the output thread waits until the output is able to
successfully send the message. The output stops reading from the output queue,
which means the queue can fill up with events.</p>
<p>When the output queue is full, filters are blocked because they cannot write new
events to the output queue. While they are blocked from writing to the output
queue, filters stop reading from the filter queue. Eventually, this can cause
the filter queue (input &#8594; filter) to fill up.</p>
<p>A full filter queue blocks inputs from writing to the filters. This causes all
inputs to stop processing data from wherever they&#8217;re getting new events.</p>
<p>In ideal circumstances, this behaves similarly to when the tcp window closes to
0. No new data is sent because the receiver hasn&#8217;t finished processing the
current queue of data, but as soon as the downstream (output) problem is
resolved, messages start flowing again.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="_thread_model"></a>Thread Model</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/logstash/edit/master/docs/asciidoc/static/life-of-an-event.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>The thread model in Logstash is currently:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">input threads | filter worker threads | output worker</pre>
</div>
<p>Filters are optional, so if you have no filters defined it is simply:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">input threads | output worker</pre>
</div>
<p>Each input runs in a thread by itself. This prevents busier inputs from being
blocked by slower ones. It also allows for easier containment of scope because
each input has a thread.</p>
<p>The filter thread model is a <em>worker</em> model where each worker receives an event
and applies all filters, in order, before sending it on to the output queue.
This allows scalability across CPUs because many filters are CPU intensive
(permitting that we have thread safety).</p>
<p>The default number of filter workers is 1, but you can increase this number by
specifying the <em>-w</em> flag when you run the Logstash agent.</p>
<p>The output worker model is currently a single thread. Outputs receive events in
the order the outputs are defined in the config file.</p>
<p>Outputs might decide to temporarily buffer events before publishing them. One
example of this is the <code class="literal">elasticsearch</code> output, which buffers events and flushes
them all at once using a separate thread. This mechanism (buffering many events
and writing in a separate thread) can improve performance because it prevents
the Logstash pipeline from being stalled waiting for a response from
elasticsearch.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h3><a id="_resource_usage"></a>Resource Usage</h3><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/logstash/edit/master/docs/asciidoc/static/life-of-an-event.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Logstash typically has at least 3 threads (2 if you have no filters). One input
thread, one filter worker thread, and one output thread. If you see Logstash
using multiple CPUs, this is likely why. If you want to know more about what
each thread is doing, you should read this article:
<a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/debugging-java-performance.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Debugging Java Performance</a>.
Threads in Java have names and you can use <code class="literal">jstack</code> and <code class="literal">top</code> to figure out who
is using what resources.</p>
<p>On Linux platforms, Logstash labels all the threads it can with something
descriptive. For example, inputs show up as <code class="literal">&lt;inputname</code>, filter workers show up
as <code class="literal">|worker</code>, and outputs show up as <code class="literal">&gt;outputworker</code>.  Where possible, other
threads are also labeled to help you identify their purpose should you wonder
why they are consuming resources!</p>
