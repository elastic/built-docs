<p>All Issues and Pull Requests must be tracked using the Github issue tracker.</p>
<p>The plugin uses the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" class="ulink" target="_top">Apache 2.0 license</a>. Maintainers should check whether a
patch introduces code which has an incompatible license. Patch ownership and copyright is defined in the Elastic
<a href="/contributor-agreement" class="ulink" target="_top">Contributor License Agreement</a> (CLA).</p>

<p>A "Contributor" is a role a person assumes when providing a patch. Contributors will not have commit access to the
repository. They need to sign the Elastic <a href="/contributor-agreement" class="ulink" target="_top">Contributor License Agreement</a>
before a patch can be reviewed. Contributors can add themselves to the plugin Contributor list.</p>
<p>A "Maintainer" is a role a person assumes when maintaining a plugin and keeping it healthy, including triaging issues, and
reviewing and merging patches.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>A patch is a minimal and accurate answer to exactly one identified and agreed upon problem. It must conform to the
<a href="https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/master/STYLE.md" class="ulink" target="_top">code style guidelines</a> and must include RSpec tests that verify
the fitness of the solution.</p>
<p>A patch will be automatically tested by a CI system that will report on the Pull Request status.</p>
<p>A patch CLA will be automatically verified and reported on the Pull Request status.</p>
<p>A patch commit message has a single short (less than 50 character) first line summarizing the change, a blank second line,
and any additional lines as necessary for change explanation and rationale.</p>
<p>A patch is mergeable when it satisfies the above requirements and has been reviewed positively by at least one other
person.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>A user will log an issue on the issue tracker describing the problem they face or observe with as much detail as possible.</p>
<p>To work on an issue, a Contributor forks the plugin repository and then works on their forked repository and submits a
patch by creating a pull request back to the plugin.</p>
<p>Maintainers must not merge patches where the author has not signed the CLA.</p>
<p>Before a patch can be accepted it should be reviewed. Maintainers should merge accepted patches without delay.</p>
<p>Maintainers should not merge their own patches except in exceptional cases, such as non-responsiveness from other
Maintainers or core team for an extended period (more than 2 weeks).</p>
<p>Reviewer’s comments should not be based on personal preferences.</p>
<p>The Maintainers should label Issues and Pull Requests.</p>
<p>Maintainers should involve the core team if help is needed to reach consensus.</p>
<p>Review non-source changes such as documentation in the same way as source code changes.</p>

<p>The plugin has a master branch that always holds the latest in-progress version and should always build.  Topic branches
should kept to the minimum.</p>

<p>Every plugin should have a changelog (CHANGELOG.md).  If not, please create one.  When changes are made to a plugin, make sure to include a changelog entry under the respective version to document the change.  The changelog should be easily understood from a user point of view.  As we iterate and release plugins rapidly, users use the changelog as a mechanism for deciding whether to update.</p>
<p>Changes that are not user facing should be tagged as “Internal: ”.  For example:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
"Internal: Refactored specs for better testing"
</li>
<li class="listitem">
"Default timeout configuration changed from 10s to 5s"
</li>
</ul>

</div></div></div>
<p>Plugins are setup with automated continuous integration (CI) environments and there should be a corresponding badge on each Github page.  If it’s missing, please contact the Logstash core team.</p>
<p>Every Pull Request opened automatically triggers a CI run.  To conduct a manual run, comment “Jenkins, please test this.” on the Pull Request.</p>
