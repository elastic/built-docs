<p>Logstash keeps all events in main memory during processing. Logstash responds to a SIGTERM by attempting to halt inputs and waiting for pending events to finish processing before shutting down. When the pipeline cannot be flushed due to a stuck output or filter, Logstash waits indefinitely. For example, when a pipeline sends output to a database that is unreachable by the Logstash instance, the instance waits indefinitely after receiving a SIGTERM.</p>
<p>To enable Logstash to detect these situations and terminate with a stalled pipeline, use the <code class="literal">--pipeline.unsafe_shutdown</code> flag.</p>

<p>The Logstash pipeline coordinates the execution of inputs, filters, and outputs. The following schematic sketches the data flow of a pipeline:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">input threads | pipeline worker threads</pre>
</div>
<p>Pipelines in the current release of Logstash process filtering and output in the same thread. Prior to the 2.2 release of Logstash, filtering and output were distinct stages handled by distinct threads.
This change to the Logstash architecture improves performance and enables future persistence capabilities. The new pipeline substantially improves thread liveness, decreases resource usage, and increases throughput. The current Logstash pipeline is a micro-batching pipeline, which is inherently more efficient than a one-at-a-time approach. These efficiencies come in many places, two of the more prominent ones being a reduction in contention and a consequent improvement in thread liveness. These efficiencies are especially noticeable on many-core machines.</p>
<p>Each <code class="literal">input {}</code> statement in the Logstash configuration file runs in its own thread. Inputs write events to a common Java <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/SynchronousQueue.html" class="ulink" target="_top">SynchronousQueue</a>. This queue holds no events, instead transferring each pushed event to a free worker, blocking if all workers are busy. Each pipeline worker thread takes a batch of events off this queue, creating a buffer per worker, runs the batch of  events through the configured filters, then runs the filtered events through any outputs. The size of the batch and number of pipeline worker threads are configurable. The following pseudocode illustrates the process flow:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-ruby">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-ruby">synchronous_queue = SynchronousQueue.new
inputs.each do |input|
  Thread.new do
    input.run(synchronous_queue)
  end
end
num_pipeline_workers.times do
  Thread.new do
    while true
      batch = take_batch(synchronous_queue, batch_size, batch_delay)
      output_batch(filter_batch(batch))
    end
  end
end
wait_for_threads_to_terminate()</pre>
</div>
<p>There are three configurable options in the pipeline, <code class="literal">--pipeline.workers</code>, <code class="literal">--pipeline.batch.size</code>, and <code class="literal">--pipeline.batch.delay</code>.
The <code class="literal">--pipeline.workers</code> or <code class="literal">-w</code> parameter determines how many threads to run for filter and output processing. If you find that events are backing up, or that the CPU is not saturated, consider increasing the value of this parameter to make better use of available processing power. Good results can even be found increasing this number past the number of available processors as these threads may spend significant time in an I/O wait state when writing to external systems. Legal values for this parameter are positive integers.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">--pipeline.batch.size</code> or <code class="literal">-b</code> parameter defines the maximum number of events an individual worker thread collects before attempting to execute filters and outputs. Larger batch sizes are generally more efficient, but increase memory overhead. Some hardware configurations require you to increase JVM heap size by setting the <code class="literal">LS_HEAP_SIZE</code> variable to avoid performance degradation with this option. Values of this parameter in excess of the optimum range cause performance degradation due to frequent garbage collection or JVM crashes related to out-of-memory exceptions. Output plugins can process each batch as a logical unit. The Elasticsearch output, for example, issues <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html" class="ulink" target="_top">bulk requests</a> for each batch received. Tuning the <code class="literal">-b</code> parameter adjusts the size of bulk requests sent to Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">--pipeline.batch.delay</code> option rarely needs to be tuned. This option adjusts the latency of the Logstash pipeline. Pipeline batch delay is the maximum amount of time in milliseconds that Logstash waits for new messages after receiving an event in the current pipeline worker thread. After this time elapses, Logstash begins to execute filters and outputs.The maximum time that Logstash waits between receiving an event and processing that event in a filter is the product of the <code class="literal">pipeline_batch_delay</code> and  <code class="literal">pipeline_batch_size</code> settings.</p>
<h4><a id="_notes_on_pipeline_configuration_and_performance"></a>Notes on Pipeline Configuration and Performance<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/logstash/edit/5.0/docs/static/life-of-an-event.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The total number of inflight events is determined by the product of the  <code class="literal">pipeline_workers</code> and <code class="literal">pipeline_batch_size</code> parameters. This product is referred to as the <em>inflight count</em>.  Keep the value of the inflight count in mind as you adjust the <code class="literal">pipeline_workers</code> and <code class="literal">pipeline_batch_size</code> parameters. Pipelines that intermittently receive large events at irregular intervals require sufficient memory to handle these spikes. Configure the <code class="literal">LS_HEAP_SIZE</code> option accordingly.</p>
<p>The Logstash defaults are chosen to provide fast, safe performance for most users. To increase performance, increase the number of pipeline workers or the batch size, taking into account the following suggestions:</p>
<p>Measure each change to make sure it increases, rather than decreases, performance.
Ensure that you leave enough memory available to cope with a sudden increase in event size. For example, an application that generates exceptions that are represented as large blobs of text.
The number of workers may be set higher than the number of CPU cores since outputs often spend idle time in I/O wait conditions.</p>
<p>Threads in Java have names and you can use the <code class="literal">jstack</code>, <code class="literal">top</code>, and the VisualVM graphical tools to figure out which resources a given thread uses.</p>
<p>On Linux platforms, Logstash labels all the threads it can with something descriptive. For example, inputs show up as <code class="literal">[base]&lt;inputname</code>, filter/output workers show up as <code class="literal">[base]&gt;workerN</code>, where N is an integer.  Where possible, other threads are also labeled to help you identify their purpose.</p>
<h4><a id="_profiling_the_heap"></a>Profiling the Heap<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/logstash/edit/5.0/docs/static/life-of-an-event.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>When tuning Logstash you may have to adjust the heap size. You can use the <a href="https://visualvm.java.net/" class="ulink" target="_top">VisualVM</a> tool to profile the heap. The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Monitor</strong></span> pane in particular is useful for checking whether your heap allocation is sufficient for the current workload. The screenshots below show sample <span class="strong strong"><strong>Monitor</strong></span> panes. The first pane examines a Logstash instance configured with too many inflight events. The second pane examines a Logstash instance configured with an appropriate amount of inflight events. Note that the specific batch sizes used here are most likely not applicable to your specific workload, as the memory demands of Logstash vary in large part based on the type of messages you are sending.</p>

<p>In the first example we see that the CPU isn’t being used very efficiently. In fact, the JVM is often times having to stop the VM for “full GCs”. Full garbage collections are a common symptom of excessive memory pressure. This is visible in the spiky pattern on the CPU chart. In the more efficiently configured example, the GC graph pattern is more smooth, and the CPU is used in a more uniform manner. You can also see that there is ample headroom between the allocated heap size, and the maximum allowed, giving the JVM GC a lot of room to work with.</p>
<p>Examining the in-depth GC statistics with a tool similar to the excellent <a href="https://visualvm.java.net/plugins.html" class="ulink" target="_top">VisualGC</a> plugin shows that the over-allocated VM spends very little time in the efficient Eden GC, compared to the time spent in the more resource-intensive Old Gen “Full” GCs.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>As long as the GC pattern is acceptable, heap sizes that occasionally increase to the maximum are acceptable. Such heap size spikes happen in response to a burst of large events passing through the pipeline. In general practice, maintain a gap between the used amount of heap memory and the maximum.
