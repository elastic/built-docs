<h4><a id="_when_to_upgrade"></a>When to Upgrade<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/logstash/edit/7.4/docs/static/upgrading.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Fresh installations can and should start with the same version across the Elastic Stack.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch 7.0 does not require Logstash 7.0. An Elasticsearch 7.0 cluster
will happily receive data from earlier versions of Logstash via the default
HTTP communication layer. This provides some flexibility to decide when to
upgrade Logstash relative to an Elasticsearch upgrade. It may or may not be
convenient for you to upgrade them together, and it is not required to be done
at the same time as long as Elasticsearch is upgraded first.</p>
<p>You should upgrade in a timely manner to get the performance improvements that
come with Logstash 7.0, but do so in the way that makes the most sense for your
environment.</p>
<h4><a id="_when_not_to_upgrade"></a>When Not to Upgrade<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/logstash/edit/7.4/docs/static/upgrading.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>If any Logstash plugin that you require is not compatible with Logstash 7.0, then you should wait until it is ready
before upgrading.</p>
<p>Although we make great efforts to ensure compatibility, Logstash 7.0 is not completely backwards compatible. As noted
in the Elastic Stack upgrade guide, Logstash 7.0 should not be upgraded before Elasticsearch 7.0. This is both
practical and because some Logstash 7.0 plugins may attempt to use features of Elasticsearch 7.0 that did not exist
in earlier versions. For example, if you attempt to send the 7.x template to a cluster before Elasticsearch 7.0, then
all indexing likely fail. If you use your own custom template with Logstash,
then this issue can be ignored.</p>
