<p>The Pipeline indicator has a <code class="literal">flow:worker_utilization</code> probe that is capable of producing one of several diagnoses about blockages in the pipeline.</p>
<p>A pipeline is considered "blocked" when its workers are fully-utilized, because if they are consistently spending 100% of their time processing events, they are unable to pick up new events from the queue.
This can cause back-pressure to cascade to upstream services, which can result in data loss or duplicate processing depending on upstream configuration.</p>
<p>The issue typically stems from one or more causes:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
a downstream resource being blocked,
</li>
<li class="listitem">
a plugin consuming more resources than expected, and/or
</li>
<li class="listitem">
insufficient resources being allocated to the pipeline.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To address the issue, observe the <a class="xref" href="node-stats-api.html#plugin-flow-rates" title="Plugin flow rates">Plugin flow rates</a> from the <a class="xref" href="node-stats-api.html" title="Node Stats API">Node Stats API</a>, and identify which plugins have the highest <code class="literal">worker_utilization</code>.
This will tell you which plugins are spending the most of the pipeline&#8217;s worker resources.</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
If the offending plugin connects to a downstream service or another pipeline that is exerting back-pressure, the issue needs to be addressed in the downstream service or pipeline.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If the offending plugin connects to a downstream service with high network latency, throughput for the pipeline may be improved by <a class="xref" href="tuning-logstash.html#tuning-logstash-settings" title="Tuning-related settings">allocating more worker resources to the pipeline</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If the offending plugin is a computation-heavy filter such as <code class="literal">grok</code> or <code class="literal">kv</code>, its configuration may need to be tuned to eliminate wasted computation.
</li>
</ul>

<p>A pipeline that has been completely blocked for five minutes or more represents a critical blockage to the flow of events through your pipeline that needs to be addressed immediately to avoid or limit data loss.
