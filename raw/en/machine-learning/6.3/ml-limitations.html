<p>The following limitations and known problems apply to the 6.3.2 release of
X-Pack:</p>
<h3><a id="_categorization_uses_english_dictionary_words"></a>Categorization uses English dictionary words<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Categorization identifies static parts of unstructured logs and groups similar
messages together. The default categorization tokenizer assumes English language
log messages. For other languages you must define a different
<code class="literal">categorization_analyzer</code> for your job. For more information, see
<a class="xref" href="ml-configuring-categories.html" title="Categorizing log messages">Categorizing log messages</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a dictionary used to influence the categorization process contains
only English words. This means categorization might work better in English than
in other languages. The ability to customize the dictionary will be added in a
future release.</p>
<h3><a id="_pop_ups_must_be_enabled_in_browsers"></a>Pop-ups must be enabled in browsers<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The machine learning features in Kibana use pop-ups. You must configure your
web browser so that it does not block pop-up windows or create an
exception for your Kibana URL.</p>
<h3><a id="_x_pack_machine_learning_features_are_not_supported_on_tribe_nodes"></a>X-Pack machine learning features are not supported on tribe nodes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You cannot use machine learning features on tribe nodes. For more information about that
type of node, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/modules-tribe.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Tribe node</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_anomaly_explorer_omissions_and_limitations"></a>Anomaly Explorer omissions and limitations<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In Kibana, Anomaly Explorer charts are not displayed for anomalies
that were due to categorization, <code class="literal">time_of_day</code> functions, or <code class="literal">time_of_week</code>
functions. Those particular results do not display well as time series
charts.</p>
<p>The charts are also not displayed for detectors that use script fields. In that
case, the original source data cannot be easily searched because it has been
somewhat transformed by the script.</p>
<p>The Anomaly Explorer charts can also look odd in circumstances where there
is very little data to plot. For example, if there is only one data point, it is
represented as a single dot. If there are only two data points, they are joined
by a line.</p>
<h3><a id="_jobs_close_on_the_datafeed_end_date"></a>Jobs close on the datafeed end date<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If you start a datafeed and specify an end date, it will close the job when
the datafeed stops. This behavior avoids having numerous open one-time jobs.</p>
<p>If you do not specify an end date when you start a datafeed, the job
remains open when you stop the datafeed. This behavior avoids the overhead
of closing and re-opening large jobs when there are pauses in the datafeed.</p>
<h3><a id="_jobs_created_in_kibana_must_use_datafeeds"></a>Jobs created in Kibana must use datafeeds<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If you create jobs in Kibana, you must use datafeeds. If the data that you want to
analyze is not stored in Elasticsearch, you cannot use datafeeds and therefore you cannot
create your jobs in Kibana. You can, however, use the machine learning APIs to create jobs
and to send batches of data directly to the jobs. For more information, see
<a class="xref" href="ml-dfeeds.html" title="Datafeeds">Datafeeds</a> and <a class="xref" href="ml-api-quickref.html" title="API quick reference"><em>API quick reference</em></a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_post_data_api_requires_json_format"></a>Post data API requires JSON format<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The post data API enables you to send data to a job for analysis. The data that
you send to the job must use the JSON format.</p>
<p>For more information about this API, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/ml-post-data.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Post Data to Jobs</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_misleading_high_missing_field_counts"></a>Misleading high missing field counts<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>One of the counts associated with a machine learning job is <code class="literal">missing_field_count</code>,
which indicates the number of records that are missing a configured field.</p>
<p>Since jobs analyze JSON data, the <code class="literal">missing_field_count</code> might be misleading.
Missing fields might be expected due to the structure of the data and therefore
do not generate poor results.</p>
<p>For more information about <code class="literal">missing_field_count</code>,
see <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/ml-jobstats.html#ml-datacounts" class="ulink" target="_top">Data Counts Objects</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_terms_aggregation_size_affects_data_analysis"></a>Terms aggregation size affects data analysis<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>By default, the <code class="literal">terms</code> aggregation returns the buckets for the top ten terms.
You can change this default behavior by setting the <code class="literal">size</code> parameter.</p>
<p>If you are send pre-aggregated data to a job for analysis, you must ensure
that the <code class="literal">size</code> is configured correctly. Otherwise, some data might not be
analyzed.</p>
<h3><a id="_time_based_index_patterns_are_not_supported"></a>Time-based index patterns are not supported<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>It is not possible to create a machine learning analysis job that uses time-based
index patterns, for example <code class="literal">[logstash-]YYYY.MM.DD</code>.
This applies to the single metric or multi metric job creation wizards in Kibana.</p>
<h3><a id="_fields_named_by_count_or_over_cannot_be_used_to_split_data"></a>Fields named "by", "count", or "over" cannot be used to split data<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You cannot use the following field names in the <code class="literal">by_field_name</code> or
<code class="literal">over_field_name</code> properties in a job: <code class="literal">by</code>; <code class="literal">count</code>; <code class="literal">over</code>. This limitation
also applies to those properties when you create advanced jobs in Kibana.</p>
<h3><a id="_jobs_created_in_kibana_use_model_plot_config_and_pre_aggregated_data"></a>Jobs created in Kibana use model plot config and pre-aggregated data<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If you create single or multi-metric jobs in Kibana, it might enable some
options under the covers that you&#8217;d want to reconsider for large or
long-running jobs.</p>
<p>For example, when you create a single metric job in Kibana, it generally
enables the <code class="literal">model_plot_config</code> advanced configuration option. That configuration
option causes model information to be stored along with the results and provides
a more detailed view into anomaly detection. It is specifically used by the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span> in Kibana. When this option is enabled, however, it can
add considerable overhead to the performance of the system. If you have jobs
with many entities, for example data from tens of thousands of servers, storing
this additional model information for every bucket might be problematic. If you
are not certain that you need this option or if you experience performance
issues, edit your job configuration to disable this option.</p>
<p>For more information, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/ml-job-resource.html#ml-apimodelplotconfig" class="ulink" target="_top">Model Plot Config</a>.</p>
<p>Likewise, when you create a single or multi-metric job in Kibana, in some cases
it uses aggregations on the data that it retrieves from Elasticsearch. One of the
benefits of summarizing data this way is that Elasticsearch automatically distributes
these calculations across your cluster. This summarized data is then fed into
machine learning instead of raw results, which reduces the volume of data that must
be considered while detecting anomalies.  However, if you have two jobs, one of
which uses pre-aggregated data and another that does not, their results might
differ. This difference is due to the difference in precision of the input data.
The machine learning analytics are designed to be aggregation-aware and the likely increase
in performance that is gained by pre-aggregating the data makes the potentially
poorer precision worthwhile. If you want to view or change the aggregations
that are used in your job, refer to the <code class="literal">aggregations</code> property in your datafeed.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/ml-datafeed-resource.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Datafeed Resources</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_security_integration"></a>Security integration<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When X-Pack security is enabled, a datafeed stores the roles of the user who created
or updated the datafeed <span class="strong strong"><strong>at that time</strong></span>. This means that if those roles are
updated then the datafeed subsequently runs with the new permissions that are
associated with the roles. However, if the user&#8217;s roles are adjusted after
creating or updating the datafeed, the datafeed continues to run with the
permissions that were associated with the original roles. For more information,
see <a class="xref" href="ml-dfeeds.html" title="Datafeeds">Datafeeds</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_forecasts_cannot_be_created_for_population_jobs"></a>Forecasts cannot be created for population jobs<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If you use an <code class="literal">over_field_name</code> property in your job (that is to say, it&#8217;s a
<em>population job</em>), you cannot create a forecast. If you try to create a forecast
for this type of job, an error occurs. For more information about forecasts,
see <a class="xref" href="ml-overview.html#ml-forecasting" title="Forecasting the future">Forecasting the future</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_forecasts_cannot_be_created_for_jobs_that_use_geographic_rare_or_time_functions"></a>Forecasts cannot be created for jobs that use geographic, rare, or time functions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If you use any of the following analytical functions in your job, you cannot
create a forecast:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">lat_long</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">rare</code> and <code class="literal">freq_rare</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">time_of_day</code> and <code class="literal">time_of_week</code>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If you try to create a forecast for this type of job, an error occurs. For more
information about any of these functions, see <a class="xref" href="ml-functions.html" title="Function reference"><em>Function reference</em></a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_jobs_must_be_stopped_before_upgrades"></a>Jobs must be stopped before upgrades<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You must stop any machine learning jobs that are running before you start the upgrade
process. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="stopping-ml.html" title="Stopping machine learning"><em>Stopping machine learning</em></a> and
<a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack/6.3/upgrading-elastic-stack.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrading the Elastic Stack</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_rollup_indices_and_index_patterns_are_not_supported"></a>Rollup indices and index patterns are not supported<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/ml/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Rollup indices and index patterns cannot be used in machine learning jobs or
datafeeds. This limitation applies irrespective of whether you create the jobs in
Kibana or by using APIs. In Kibana, if you select an index, saved search, or index
pattern that uses the Rollup feature, the machine learning job creation wizards fail.</p>
