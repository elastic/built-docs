<p>The machine learning features use the concept of a <em>bucket</em> to divide the time series
into batches for processing.</p>
<p>The <em>bucket span</em> is part of the configuration information for a job. It defines
the time interval that is used to summarize and model the data. This is
typically between 5 minutes to 1 hour and it depends on your data characteristics.
When you set the bucket span, take into account the granularity at which you
want to analyze, the frequency of the input data, the typical duration of the
anomalies, and the frequency at which alerting is required.</p>
<p>When you view your machine learning results, each bucket has an anomaly score. This score is
a statistically aggregated and normalized view of the combined anomalousness of
all the record results in the bucket. If you have more than one job, you can
also obtain overall bucket results, which combine and correlate anomalies from
multiple jobs into an overall score. When you view the results for jobs groups
in Kibana, it provides the overall bucket scores.</p>
