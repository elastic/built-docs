<p>The multi-metric job wizard in Kibana provides a simple way to create more
complex jobs with multiple detectors. For example, in the single metric job, you
were tracking total requests versus time. You might also want to track other
metrics like average response time or the maximum number of denied requests.
Instead of creating jobs for each of those metrics, you can combine them in a
multi-metric job.</p>
<p>You can also use multi-metric jobs to split a single time series into multiple
time series based on a categorical field. For example, you can split the data
based on its hostnames, locations, or users. Each time series is modeled
independently. By looking at temporal patterns on a per entity basis, you might
spot things that might have otherwise been hidden in the lumped view.</p>
<p>Conceptually, you can think of this as running many independent single metric
jobs. By bundling them together in a multi-metric job, however, you can see an
overall score and shared influencers for all the metrics and all the entities in
the job. Multi-metric jobs therefore scale better than having many independent
single metric jobs and provide better results when you have influencers that are
shared across the detectors.</p>
<p>The sample data for this tutorial contains information about the requests that
are received by various applications and services in a system. Let&#8217;s assume that
you want to monitor the requests received and the response time.  In particular,
you might want to track those metrics on a per service basis to see if any
services have unusual patterns.</p>
<p>To create a multi-metric job in Kibana:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Open Kibana in your web browser. If you are running Kibana locally,
go to <code class="literal">http://localhost:5601/</code>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Machine Learning</strong></span> in the side navigation, then click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Create new job</strong></span>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Select the index pattern that you created for the sample data.  For example,
<code class="literal">server-metrics*</code>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
In the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Use a wizard</strong></span> section, click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Multi metric</strong></span>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Configure the job by providing the following job settings:<br></p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
For the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Fields</strong></span>, select <code class="literal">high mean(response)</code> and <code class="literal">sum(total)</code>. This
creates two detectors and specifies the analysis function and field that each
detector uses. The first detector uses the high mean function to detect
unusually high average values for the <code class="literal">response</code> field in each bucket. The
second detector uses the sum function to detect when the sum of the <code class="literal">total</code>
field is anomalous in each bucket. For more information about any of the
analytical functions, see <a class="xref" href="ml-functions.html" title="Function reference"><em>Function reference</em></a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
For the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Bucket span</strong></span>, enter <code class="literal">10m</code>. This value specifies the size of the
interval that the analysis is aggregated into. As was the case in the single
metric example, this value has a significant impact on the analysis. When you&#8217;re
creating jobs for your own data, you might need to experiment with different
bucket spans depending on the frequency of the input data, the duration of
typical anomalies, and the frequency at which alerting is required.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>For the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Split Data</strong></span>, select <code class="literal">service</code>. When you specify this
option, the analysis is segmented such that you have completely independent
baselines for each distinct value of this field.
There are seven unique service keyword values in the sample data. Thus for each
of the seven services, you will see the high mean response metrics and sum
total metrics.<br></p>

<div class="admon_content">
<p>If you are creating a job by using the machine learning APIs or the advanced job
wizard in Kibana, you can accomplish this split by using the
<code class="literal">partition_field_name</code> property.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>For the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Key Fields (Influencers)</strong></span>, select <code class="literal">host</code>. Note that the <code class="literal">service</code> field
is also automatically selected because you used it to split the data. These key
fields are also known as <em>influencers</em>.
When you identify a field as an influencer, you are indicating that you think
it contains information about someone or something that influences or
contributes to anomalies.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Picking an influencer is strongly recommended for the following reasons:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
It allows you to more easily assign blame for the anomaly
</li>
<li class="listitem">
It simplifies and aggregates the results
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The best influencer is the person or thing that you want to blame for the
anomaly. In many cases, users or client IP addresses make excellent influencers.
Influencers can be any field in your data; they do not need to be fields that
are specified in your detectors, though they often are.</p>
<p>As a best practice, do not pick too many influencers. For example, you generally
do not need more than three. If you pick many influencers, the results can be
overwhelming and there is a small overhead to the analysis.</p>

<li class="listitem">
<p>Click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Use full server-metrics* data</strong></span>. Two graphs are generated for each
<code class="literal">service</code> value, which represent the high mean <code class="literal">response</code> values and
sum <code class="literal">total</code> values over time. For example:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job2-split.jpg" alt="Kibana charts for data split by service">
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Provide a name for the job, for example <code class="literal">response_requests_by_app</code>. The job
name must be unique in your cluster. You can also optionally provide a
description of the job.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Create Job</strong></span>.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>When the job is created, you can choose to view the results, continue the job in
real-time, and create a watch. In this tutorial, we will proceed to view the
results.</p>

<p>The <code class="literal">create_multi_metric.sh</code> script, which is included with the
<a class="xref" href="ml-gs-data.html#ml-gs-sampledata" title="Obtaining a sample data set">sample data</a>, creates a similar job and datafeed by
using the machine learning APIs. Before you run it, you must edit the USERNAME and PASSWORD
variables with your actual user ID and password. If X-Pack security is not enabled,
use the <code class="literal">create_multi_metric_noauth.sh</code> script instead. For API reference
information, see <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.4/ml-apis.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Machine Learning APIs</a>.</p>
