<p>Where possible, machine learning jobs are assigned to nodes based on the memory requirement
of the job and the memory available on the node. However, in certain cases, the
amount of memory on a node cannot be accurately determined and jobs are assigned
by balancing the number of jobs per machine learning node. It may lead to a situation where
all the jobs with high memory requirements are on one node and the less
memory-intensive jobs on another.</p>
<p>One particular case of this problem is that Elasticsearch fails to determine the amount
of memory on a machine that is running Debian 8 with the default Cgroups setup
and certain updates of Java versions earlier than Java 15. For example, Java
8u271 is known to be affected while Java 8u272 is not. Java 15 was fixed from
its initial release.</p>
<p>If you are running Elasticsearch on Debian 8 with an old version of Java and have not
already modified the Cgroups setup then it is recommended to do one of the
following:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Upgrade Java to version 15.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Upgrade to the latest Java update for the version of Java you are running.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Enable the "memory" Cgroup by editing <code class="literal">/etc/default/grub</code> and adding:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-sh">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-sh">GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1"</pre>
</div>
<p>Update your GRUB configuration by running <code class="literal">sudo update-grub</code>, then reboot the
machine.</p>

</ul>
