<p>The machine learning features analyze the input stream of data, model its behavior, and
perform analysis based on the two detectors you defined in your job. When an
event occurs outside of the model, that event is identified as an anomaly.</p>
<p>You can use the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span> in Kibana to view the analysis results:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job2-explorer.jpg" alt="Job results in the Anomaly Explorer">
</div>
</div>
<p>You can explore the overall anomaly time line, which shows the maximum anomaly
score for each section in the specified time period. You can change the time
period by using the time picker in the Kibana toolbar. Note that the sections in
this time line do not necessarily correspond to the bucket span. If you change
the time period, the sections change size too. The smallest possible size for
these sections is a bucket. If you specify a large time period, the sections can
span many buckets.</p>
<p>On the left is a list of the top influencers for all of the detected anomalies
in that same time period. The list includes maximum anomaly scores, which in
this case are aggregated for each influencer, for each bucket, across all
detectors. There is also a total sum of the anomaly scores for each influencer.
You can use this list to help you narrow down the contributing factors and focus
on the most anomalous entities.</p>
<p>If your job contains influencers, you can also explore swim lanes that
correspond to the values of an influencer. In this example, the swim lanes
correspond to the values for the <code class="literal">service</code> field that you used to split the data.
Each lane represents a unique application or service name. Since you specified
the <code class="literal">host</code> field as an influencer, you can also optionally view the results in
swim lanes for each host name:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job2-explorer-host.jpg" alt="Job results sorted by host">
</div>
</div>
<p>By default, the swim lanes are ordered by their maximum anomaly score values.
You can click on the sections in the swim lane to see details about the
anomalies that occurred in that time interval.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The anomaly scores that you see in each section of the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span>
might differ slightly. This disparity occurs because for each job we generate
bucket results, influencer results, and record results. Anomaly scores are
generated for each type of result. The anomaly timeline uses the bucket-level
anomaly scores. The list of top influencers uses the influencer-level anomaly
scores. The list of anomalies uses the record-level anomaly scores. For more
information about these different result types, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/ml-results-resource.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Results Resources</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Click on a section in the swim lanes to obtain more information about the
anomalies in that time period. For example, click on the red section in the swim
lane for <code class="literal">server_2</code>:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job2-explorer-anomaly.jpg" alt="Job results for an anomaly">
</div>
</div>
<p>You can see exact times when anomalies occurred and which detectors or metrics
caught the anomaly. Also note that because you split the data by the <code class="literal">service</code>
field, you see separate charts for each applicable service. In particular, you
see charts for each service for which there is data on the specified host in the
specified time interval.</p>
<p>Below the charts, there is a table that provides more information, such as the
typical and actual values and the influencers that contributed to the anomaly.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job2-explorer-table.jpg" alt="Job results table">
</div>
</div>
<p>Notice that there are anomalies for both detectors, that is to say for both the
<code class="literal">high_mean(response)</code> and the <code class="literal">sum(total)</code> metrics in this time interval. The
table aggregates the anomalies to show the highest severity anomaly per detector
and entity, which is the by, over, or partition field value that is displayed
in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>found for</strong></span> column. To view all the anomalies without any aggregation,
set the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Interval</strong></span> to <code class="literal">Show all</code>.</p>
<p>By
investigating multiple metrics in a single job, you might see relationships
between events in your data that would otherwise be overlooked.</p>
