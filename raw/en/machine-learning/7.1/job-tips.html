<p>When you are creating a job in Kibana, the job creation wizards can provide
advice based on the characteristics of your data. By heeding these suggestions,
you can create jobs that are more likely to produce insightful machine learning results.</p>
<div class="section">

<h3 class="title"><a id="bucket-span"></a>Bucket span<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.1/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/job-tips.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
</div></div></div>
<p>The bucket span is the time interval that machine learning analytics use to summarize and
model data for your job. When you create a job in Kibana, you can choose to
estimate a bucket span value based on your data characteristics.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The bucket span must contain a valid time interval. For more information,
see <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.1/ml-job-resource.html#ml-analysisconfig" class="ulink" target="_top">Analysis configuration objects</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you choose a value that is larger than one day or is significantly different
than the estimated value, you receive an informational message. For more
information about choosing an appropriate bucket span, see <a class="xref" href="ml-buckets.html" title="Buckets">Buckets</a>.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>If there are logical groupings of related entities in your data, machine learning analytics
can make data models and generate results that take these groupings into
consideration. For example, you might choose to split your data by user ID and
detect when users are accessing resources differently than they usually do.</p>
<p>If the field that you use to split your data has many different values, the
job uses more memory resources. In particular, if the cardinality of the
<code class="literal">by_field_name</code>, <code class="literal">over_field_name</code>, or <code class="literal">partition_field_name</code> is greater than
1000, you are advised that there might be high memory usage.</p>
<p>Likewise if you are performing population analysis and the cardinality of the
<code class="literal">over_field_name</code> is below 10, you are advised that this might not be a suitable
field to use. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="ml-configuring-pop.html" title="Performing population analysis">Performing population analysis</a>.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>Each job must have one or more <em>detectors</em>. A detector applies an analytical
function to specific fields in your data. If your job does not contain a
detector or the detector does not contain a
<a class="xref" href="ml-functions.html" title="Function reference">valid function</a>, you receive an error.</p>
<p>If a job contains duplicate detectors, you also receive an error. Detectors are
duplicates if they have the same <code class="literal">function</code>, <code class="literal">field_name</code>, <code class="literal">by_field_name</code>,
<code class="literal">over_field_name</code> and <code class="literal">partition_field_name</code>.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>When you create a job, you can specify <em>influencers</em>, which are also sometimes
referred to as <em>key fields</em>. Picking an influencer is strongly recommended for
the following reasons:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
It allows you to more easily assign blame for the anomaly
</li>
<li class="listitem">
It simplifies and aggregates the results
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The best influencer is the person or thing that you want to blame for the
anomaly. In many cases, users or client IP addresses make excellent influencers.
Influencers can be any field in your data; they do not need to be fields that
are specified in your detectors, though they often are.</p>
<p>As a best practice, do not pick too many influencers. For example, you generally
do not need more than three. If you pick many influencers, the results can be
overwhelming and there is a small overhead to the analysis.</p>
<p>The job creation wizards in Kibana can suggest which fields to use as influencers.</p>

<h3 class="title"><a id="model-memory-limits"></a>Model memory limits<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.1/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/job-tips.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
</div></div></div>
<p>For each job, you can optionally specify a <code class="literal">model_memory_limit</code>, which is the
approximate maximum amount of memory resources that are required for analytical
processing. The default value is 1 GB. Once this limit is approached, data
pruning becomes more aggressive. Upon exceeding this limit, new entities are not
modeled.</p>
<p>You can also optionally specify the <code class="literal">xpack.ml.max_model_memory_limit</code> setting.
By default, it&#8217;s not set, which means there is no upper bound on the acceptable
<code class="literal">model_memory_limit</code> values in your jobs.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If you set the <code class="literal">model_memory_limit</code> too high, it will be impossible to open
the job; jobs cannot be allocated to nodes that have insufficient memory to run
them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If the estimated model memory limit for a job is greater than the model memory
limit for the job or the maximum model memory limit for the cluster, the job
creation wizards in Kibana generate a warning. If the estimated memory
requirement is only a little higher than the <code class="literal">model_memory_limit</code>, the job will
probably produce useful results. Otherwise, the actions you take to address
these warnings vary depending on the resources available in your cluster:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
If you are using the default value for the <code class="literal">model_memory_limit</code> and the machine learning
nodes in the cluster have lots of memory, the best course of action might be to
simply increase the job&#8217;s <code class="literal">model_memory_limit</code>. Before doing this, however,
double-check that the chosen analysis makes sense. The default
<code class="literal">model_memory_limit</code> is relatively low to avoid accidentally creating a job that
uses a huge amount of memory.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>If the machine learning nodes in the cluster do not have sufficient memory to accommodate
a job of the estimated size, the only options are:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Add bigger machine learning nodes to the cluster, or
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Accept that the job will hit its memory limit and will not necessarily find
all the anomalies it could otherwise find.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If you are using Elastic Cloud Enterprise or the hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud,
<code class="literal">xpack.ml.max_model_memory_limit</code> is set to prevent you from creating jobs
that cannot be allocated to any machine learning nodes in the cluster. If you find that you
cannot increase <code class="literal">model_memory_limit</code> for your machine learning jobs, the solution is to
increase the size of the machine learning nodes in your cluster.</p>
<p>For more information about the <code class="literal">model_memory_limit</code> property and the
<code class="literal">xpack.ml.max_model_memory_limit</code> setting, see
