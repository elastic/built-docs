<p>The machine learning features automate the analysis of time-series data by creating
accurate baselines of normal behavior in the data and identifying anomalous
patterns in that data. You can submit your data for analysis in batches or
continuously in real-time datafeeds.</p>
<p>Using proprietary machine learning algorithms, the following circumstances are detected,
scored, and linked with statistically significant influencers in the data:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Anomalies related to temporal deviations in values, counts, or frequencies
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Statistical rarity
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Unusual behaviors for a member of a population
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Automated periodicity detection and quick adaptation to changing data ensure
that you don’t need to specify algorithms, models, or other data science-related
configurations in order to get the benefits of machine learning.</p>
<p>You can view the machine learning results in Kibana where, for example, charts illustrate the
actual data values, the bounds for the expected values, and the anomalies that
occur outside these bounds.</p>

<h3><a id="ml-forecasting"></a>Forecasting the future<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.1/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/forecasting.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>After the machine learning features create baselines of normal behavior for your data,
you can use that information to extrapolate future behavior.</p>
<p>You can use a forecast to estimate a time series value at a specific future date.
For example, you might want to determine how many users you can expect to visit
your website next Sunday at 0900.</p>
<p>You can also use it to estimate the probability of a time series value occurring
at a future date. For example, you might want to determine how likely it is that
your disk utilization will reach 100% before the end of next week.</p>
<p>Each forecast has a unique ID, which you can use to distinguish between forecasts
that you created at different times. You can create a forecast by using the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.1/ml-forecast.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Forecast Jobs API</a> or by using Kibana. For example:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job-forecast.jpg" alt="Example screenshot from the Machine Learning Single Metric Viewer in Kibana">
</div>
</div>
<p>The yellow line in the chart represents the predicted data values. The
shaded yellow area represents the bounds for the predicted values, which also
gives an indication of the confidence of the predictions.</p>
<p>When you create a forecast, you specify its <em>duration</em>, which indicates how far
the forecast extends beyond the last record that was processed. By default, the
duration is 1 day. Typically the farther into the future that you forecast, the
lower the confidence levels become (that is to say, the bounds increase).
Eventually if the confidence levels are too low, the forecast stops.</p>
<p>You can also optionally specify when the forecast expires. By default, it
expires in 14 days and is deleted automatically thereafter. You can specify a
different expiration period by using the <code class="literal">expires_in</code> parameter in the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.1/ml-forecast.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Forecast Jobs API</a>.</p>
<p>There are some limitations that affect your ability to create a forecast:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You can generate only three forecasts concurrently. There is no limit to the
number of forecasts that you retain. Existing forecasts are not overwritten when
you create new forecasts. Rather, they are automatically deleted when they expire.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you use an <code class="literal">over_field_name</code> property in your job (that is to say, it&#8217;s a
<em>population job</em>), you cannot create a forecast.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>If you use any of the following analytical functions in your job, you
cannot create a forecast:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">lat_long</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">rare</code> and <code class="literal">freq_rare</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><code class="literal">time_of_day</code> and <code class="literal">time_of_week</code></p>
<p>For more information about any of these functions, see <a class="xref" href="ml-functions.html" title="Function reference"><em>Function reference</em></a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Forecasts run concurrently with real-time machine learning analysis. That is to say, machine learning
analysis does not stop while forecasts are generated. Forecasts can have an
impact on machine learning jobs, however, especially in terms of memory usage. For this
reason, forecasts run only if the model memory status is acceptable.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The job must be open when you create a forecast. Otherwise, an error occurs.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If there is insufficient data to generate any meaningful predictions, an
error occurs. In general, forecasts that are created early in the learning phase
of the data analysis are less accurate.
