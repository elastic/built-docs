<p>Machine learning uses Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) 4.2 instructions, so it works only
on machines whose CPUs
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#Supporting_CPUs" class="ulink" target="_top">support</a> SSE4.2. If you run
Elasticsearch on older hardware you must disable machine learning by setting <code class="literal">xpack.ml.enabled</code> to
<code class="literal">false</code>. See <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/ml-settings.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Machine learning settings in Elasticsearch</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="ml-scheduling-priority"></a>CPU scheduling improvements apply to Linux and MacOS only<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>When there are many machine learning jobs running at the same time and there are
insufficient CPU resources, the JVM performance must be prioritized so search
and indexing latency remain acceptable. To that end, when CPU is constrained on
Linux and MacOS environments, the CPU scheduling priority of native analysis
processes is reduced to favor the Elasticsearch JVM. This improvement does not apply to
Windows environments.</p>
<h3><a id="ad-config-limitations"></a>Configuration limitations<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>

<p>By default, the <code class="literal">terms</code> aggregation returns the buckets for the top ten terms.
You can change this default behavior by setting the <code class="literal">size</code> parameter.</p>
<p>If you send pre-aggregated data to a job for analysis, you must ensure that the
<code class="literal">size</code> is configured correctly. Otherwise, some data might not be analyzed.</p>
<h4><a id="_fields_named_by_count_or_over_cannot_be_used_to_split_data"></a>Fields named "by", "count", or "over" cannot be used to split data<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>You cannot use the following field names in the <code class="literal">by_field_name</code> or
<code class="literal">over_field_name</code> properties in a job: <code class="literal">by</code>; <code class="literal">count</code>; <code class="literal">over</code>. This limitation
also applies to those properties when you create advanced jobs in Kibana.</p>
<h4><a id="_rollup_indices_and_index_patterns_are_not_supported"></a>Rollup indices and index patterns are not supported<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Rollup indices and index patterns cannot be used in machine learning jobs or
datafeeds. This limitation applies irrespective of whether you create the jobs in
Kibana or by using APIs. In Kibana, if you select an index, saved search, or index
pattern that uses the Rollup feature, the machine learning job creation wizards fail.</p>
<p>See <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/xpack-rollup.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Rolling up historical data</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="ml-frozen-limitations"></a>Frozen indices are not supported<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p><a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/frozen-indices.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Frozen indices</a> cannot be used in anomaly detection jobs or
datafeeds. This limitation applies irrespective of whether you create the jobs in
Kibana or by using APIs. This limitation exists because it&#8217;s currently not
possible to specify the <code class="literal">ignore_throttled</code> query parameter for search requests
in datafeeds or jobs. See
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/searching_a_frozen_index.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Searching a frozen index</a>.</p>

<p>There are some limitations that affect your ability to create a forecast:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You can generate only three forecasts per anomaly detection job concurrently. There is
no limit to the number of forecasts that you retain. Existing forecasts are not
overwritten when you create new forecasts. Rather, they are automatically
deleted when they expire.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you use an <code class="literal">over_field_name</code> property in your anomaly detection job (that is to
say, it&#8217;s a <em>population job</em>), you cannot create a forecast.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>If you use any of the following analytical functions in your anomaly detection job,
you cannot create a forecast:</p>

<h3><a id="ad-operational-limitations"></a>Operational limitations<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<h4><a id="_categorization_uses_english_dictionary_words"></a>Categorization uses English dictionary words<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Categorization identifies static parts of unstructured logs and groups similar
messages together. The default categorization tokenizer assumes English language
log messages. For other languages you must define a different
<code class="literal">categorization_analyzer</code> for your job. For more information, see
<a class="xref" href="ml-configuring-categories.html" title="Detecting anomalous categories of data">Detecting anomalous categories of data</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a dictionary used to influence the categorization process contains
only English words. This means categorization might work better in English than
in other languages. The ability to customize the dictionary will be added in a
future release.</p>
<h4><a id="_post_data_api_requires_json_format"></a>Post data API requires JSON format<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The post data API enables you to send data to a job for analysis. The data that
you send to the job must use the JSON format.</p>
<p>For more information about this API, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/ml-post-data.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Post Data to Jobs</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="_misleading_high_missing_field_counts"></a>Misleading high missing field counts<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>One of the counts associated with a machine learning job is <code class="literal">missing_field_count</code>,
which indicates the number of records that are missing a configured field.</p>
<p>Since jobs analyze JSON data, the <code class="literal">missing_field_count</code> might be misleading.
Missing fields might be expected due to the structure of the data and therefore
do not generate poor results.</p>
<p>For more information about <code class="literal">missing_field_count</code>,
see the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/ml-get-job-stats.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get anomaly detection job statistics API</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="_security_integration"></a>Security integration<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>When the Elasticsearch security features are enabled, a datafeed stores the roles of the
user who created or updated the datafeed <span class="strong strong"><strong>at that time</strong></span>. This means that if the
roles the user has are changed after they create or update a datafeed then the
datafeed continues to run without change. However, if instead the permissions
associated with the roles that are stored with the datafeed are changed then this
affects the datafeed. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="ml-datafeeds.html" title="Datafeeds">Datafeeds</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="ml-result-size-limitations"></a>Job and datafeed APIs have a maximum search size<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>In 6.6 and later releases, the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/ml-get-job.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get jobs API</a> and the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/ml-get-job-stats.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get job statistics API</a> return a maximum of 10,000
jobs. Likewise, the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/ml-get-datafeed.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get datafeeds API</a> and the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/ml-get-datafeed-stats.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get datafeed statistics API</a> return a maximum of
10,000 datafeeds.</p>

<p>There are some factors that may be considered when you run forecasts:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Forecasts run concurrently with real-time machine learning analysis. That is to say, machine learning
analysis does not stop while forecasts are generated. Forecasts can have an
impact on anomaly detection jobs, however, especially in terms of memory usage. For this
reason, forecasts run only if the model memory status is acceptable.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The anomaly detection job must be open when you create a forecast. Otherwise, an error
occurs.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If there is insufficient data to generate any meaningful predictions, an
error occurs. In general, forecasts that are created early in the learning phase
of the data analysis are less accurate.
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="ad-ui-limitations"></a>Limitations in Kibana<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<h4><a id="_pop_ups_must_be_enabled_in_browsers"></a>Pop-ups must be enabled in browsers<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The machine learning features in Kibana use pop-ups. You must configure your web browser so
that it does not block pop-up windows or create an exception for your Kibana URL.</p>
<h4><a id="_anomaly_explorer_and_single_metric_viewer_omissions_and_limitations"></a>Anomaly Explorer and Single Metric Viewer omissions and limitations<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>In Kibana, <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span> and <span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span> charts are not
displayed for anomalies that were due to categorization (if model plot is not
enabled), <code class="literal">time_of_day</code> functions, <code class="literal">time_of_week</code> functions, or <code class="literal">lat_long</code>
geographic functions.</p>
<p>If model plot is not enabled, the charts are not displayed for detectors that
use script fields either (except for scripts that define metric fields). In that
case, the original source data cannot be easily searched because it has been
transformed by the script.</p>
<p>If your <a class="xref" href="ml-configuring-aggregation.html#aggs-dfeeds" title="Nested aggregations in datafeeds">datafeed uses aggregations with nested <code class="literal">terms</code> aggs</a> and
model plot is not enabled for the anomaly detection job, neither the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly
Explorer</strong></span> nor the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span> can plot and display an anomaly
chart for the job. In these cases, the charts are not visible and an explanatory
message is shown.</p>
<p>The charts can also look odd in circumstances where there is very little data to
plot. For example, if there is only one data point, it is represented as a
single dot. If there are only two data points, they are joined by a line.</p>
<h4><a id="_jobs_created_in_kibana_must_use_datafeeds"></a>Jobs created in Kibana must use datafeeds<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>If you create jobs in Kibana, you must use datafeeds. If the data that you want to
analyze is not stored in Elasticsearch, you cannot use datafeeds and therefore you cannot
create your jobs in Kibana. You can, however, use the machine learning APIs to create jobs
and to send batches of data directly to the jobs. For more information, see
<a class="xref" href="ml-datafeeds.html" title="Datafeeds">Datafeeds</a> and <a class="xref" href="ml-api-quickref.html" title="API quick reference"><em>API quick reference</em></a>.</p>
<h4><a id="_jobs_created_in_kibana_use_model_plot_config_and_pre_aggregated_data"></a>Jobs created in Kibana use model plot config and pre-aggregated data<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>If you create single or multi-metric jobs in Kibana, it might enable some
options under the covers that you&#8217;d want to reconsider for large or
long-running jobs.</p>
<p>For example, when you create a single metric job in Kibana, it generally
enables the <code class="literal">model_plot_config</code> advanced configuration option. That
configuration option causes model information to be stored along with the
results and provides a more detailed view into anomaly detection. It is
specifically used by the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span> in Kibana. When this option is
enabled, however, it can add considerable overhead to the performance of the
system. If you have jobs with many entities, for example data from tens of
thousands of servers, storing this additional model information for every bucket
might be problematic. If you are not certain that you need this option or if you
experience performance issues, edit your job configuration to disable this
option.</p>
<p>Likewise, when you create a single or multi-metric job in Kibana, in some cases
it uses aggregations on the data that it retrieves from Elasticsearch. One of the
benefits of summarizing data this way is that Elasticsearch automatically distributes
these calculations across your cluster. This summarized data is then fed into
machine learning instead of raw results, which reduces the volume of data that must
be considered while detecting anomalies. However, if you have two jobs, one of
which uses pre-aggregated data and another that does not, their results might
differ. This difference is due to the difference in precision of the input data.
The machine learning analytics are designed to be aggregation-aware and the likely increase
in performance that is gained by pre-aggregating the data makes the potentially
poorer precision worthwhile. If you want to view or change the aggregations
that are used in your job, refer to the <code class="literal">aggregations</code> property in your datafeed.</p>
<p>When the aggregation interval of the datafeed and the bucket span of the job
don&#8217;t match, the values of the chart plotted in both the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric
Viewer</strong></span> and the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span> differ from the actual values of the job.
To avoid this behavior, make sure that the aggregation interval in the datafeed
configuration and the bucket span in the anomaly detection job configuration have the
same values.</p>
<h4><a id="ml-space-limitations"></a>Machine learning objects do not belong to Kibana spaces<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>If you create <a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.10/xpack-spaces.html" class="ulink" target="_top">spaces</a> in Kibana, you see only the
saved objects that belong to that space. This limited scope does not apply to
machine learning objects; they are visible in all of your spaces.</p>
<p>However, the Kibana machine learning features interact with some saved objects (such as
index patterns, dashboards, and visualizations) that might not be available in
all spaces. For example:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="Admonishment Admonishment--preview">
[<span class="Admonishment-title u-mono">preview</span>]
<span class="Admonishment-detail">
This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
</span>
</span> If you upload a file on the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Machine Learning</strong></span> page in Kibana,
the machine learning features identify the file format and field mappings. You can then
optionally import that data into an Elasticsearch index and create an index pattern. This
index pattern belongs to the space that is active when you import the file. If
you want to use the index pattern in other spaces, you must create it as needed.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Likewise, if you use the single-metric, multi-metric, or population job
wizards to create a job in Kibana, you can encounter problems if you subsequently
try to clone the job in a different space. In particular, problems occur when
you try to clone the job in a space that does not contain appropriate index
patterns.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you used a supplied configuration to create jobs (for example, for Apache
or NGINX web access logs), visualizations and dashboards are automatically
generated. These objects belong to the space that was active when you created
the job. If you change your active space, custom URLs from the machine learning results to
the dashboards or visualizations might fail.
