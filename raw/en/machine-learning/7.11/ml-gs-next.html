<p>By completing this tutorial, you&#8217;ve learned how you can detect anomalous
behavior in a simple set of sample data. You created anomaly detection jobs in Kibana,
which opens jobs and creates and starts datafeeds for you under the covers. You
examined the results of the machine learning analysis in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span> and
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span> in Kibana. You also extrapolated the future behavior of a
job by creating a forecast.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re now thinking about where anomaly detection can be most impactful for
your own data, there are three things to consider:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
It must be time series data.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
It should be information that contains key performance indicators for the
health, security, or success of your business or system. The better you know the
data, the quicker you will be able to create jobs that generate useful
insights.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Ideally, the data is located in Elasticsearch and you can therefore create a datafeed
that retrieves data in real time.  If your data is outside of Elasticsearch, you
cannot use Kibana to create your jobs and you cannot use datafeeds.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>In general, it is a good idea to start with single metric anomaly detection jobs for
your key performance indicators. After you examine these simple analysis results,
you will have a better idea of what the influencers might be. You can create
multi-metric jobs and split the data or create more complex analysis functions
as necessary. For examples of more complicated configuration options, see
<a class="xref" href="ml-configuration.html" title="Configure anomaly detection"><em>Configure anomaly detection</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you want to find more sample jobs, see <a class="xref" href="ootb-ml-jobs.html" title="Supplied anomaly detection configurations"><em>Supplied configurations</em></a>. In particular, there
are sample jobs for <a class="xref" href="ootb-ml-jobs-apache.html" title="Apache anomaly detection configurations">Apache</a> and
<a class="xref" href="ootb-ml-jobs-nginx.html" title="Nginx anomaly detection configurations">Nginx</a> that are quite similar to the examples in this
tutorial.</p>
