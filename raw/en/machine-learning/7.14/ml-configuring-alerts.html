<p>This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.</p>

<p>Kibana alerting features include support for machine learning rules, which run scheduled
checks on an anomaly detection job or a group of jobs to detect anomalies with certain
conditions. If an anomaly meets the conditions, an alert is created and the
associated action is triggered. For example, you can create a rule to check an
anomaly detection job every fifteen minutes for critical anomalies and to notify you in
an email. To learn more about Kibana alerting features, refer to
<a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.14/alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-getting-started" class="ulink" target="_top">Alerting</a>.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>You can create machine learning rules in the anomaly detection job wizard after you start the job,
from the job list, or under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management &gt; Alerts and Actions</strong></span>. On the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Create
rule</strong></span> window, select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly detection alert</strong></span> under the machine learning section, then
give a name to the rule and optionally provide tags.</p>
<p>Specify the time interval for the rule to check detected anomalies. It is
recommended to select an interval that is close to the bucket span of the
associated job. You can also select a notification option by using the <em>Notify</em>
selector. An alert remains active as long as anomalies are found for a
particular anomaly detection job during the check interval. When there is no anomaly
found in the next interval, the <code class="literal">Recovered</code> action group is invoked and the
status of the alert changes to <code class="literal">OK</code>. For more details, refer to the
documentation of
<a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.14/create-and-manage-rules.html#defining-rules-general-details" class="ulink" target="_top">general rule details</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Select the anomaly detection job or the group of anomaly detection jobs that is checked against
the rule. If you assign additional jobs to the group, the new jobs are
automatically checked the next time the conditions are checked.</p>
<p>You can select the result type of the anomaly detection job that is checked against the
rule. In particular, you can create rules based on bucket, record, or influencer
results.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-anomaly-alert-severity.jpg" alt="Selecting result type, severity, and test interval">
</div>
</div>
<p>For each rule, you can configure the <code class="literal">anomaly_score</code> that triggers the action.
The <code class="literal">anomaly_score</code> indicates the significance of a given anomaly compared to
previous anomalies. The default severity threshold is 75 which means every
anomaly with an <code class="literal">anomaly_score</code> of 75 or higher triggers the associated action.</p>
<p>You can select whether you want to include interim results. Interim results are
created by the anomaly detection job before a bucket is finalized. These results might
disappear after the bucket is fully processed. Include interim results if you
want to be notified earlier about a potential anomaly even if it might be a
false positive. If you want to get notified only about anomalies of fully
processed buckets, do not include interim results.</p>
<p>You can also configure advanced settings. <em>Lookback interval</em> sets an interval
that is used to query previous anomalies during each condition check. Its value
is derived from the bucket span of the job and the query delay of the datafeed by
default. It is not recommended to set the lookback interval lower than the
default value as it might result in missed anomalies. <em>Number of latest buckets</em>
sets how many buckets to check to obtain the highest anomaly from all the
anomalies that are found during the <em>Lookback interval</em>. An alert is created
based on the anomaly with the highest anomaly score from the most anomalous
bucket.</p>
<p>You can also test the configured conditions against your existing data and check
the sample results by providing a valid interval for your data. The generated
preview contains the number of potentially created alerts during the relative
time range you defined.</p>

<p>As a next step, connect your rule to actions that use supported built-in
integrations by selecting a connector type. Connectors are Kibana services or
third-party integrations that perform an action when the rule conditions are
met.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-anomaly-alert-actions.jpg" alt="Selecting connector type">
</div>
</div>
<p>For example, you can choose <em>Slack</em> as a connector type and configure it to send
a message to a channel you selected. You can also create an index connector that
writes the JSON object you configure to a specific index. It&#8217;s also possible to
customize the notification messages. A list of variables is available to include
in the message, like job ID, anomaly score, time, or top influencers.</p>

<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-anomaly-alert-messages.jpg" alt="Customizing your message">
</div>
</div>
<p>After you save the configurations, the rule appears in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alerts and Actions</strong></span> list
where you can check its status and see the overview of its configuration
information.</p>
<p>The name of an alert is always the same as the job ID of the associated
anomaly detection job that triggered it. You can mute the notifications for a particular
anomaly detection job on the page of the rule that lists the individual alerts. You can
open it via <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alerts and Actions</strong></span> by selecting the rule name.</p>
