<p>Anomaly detection jobs can analyze data that is stored in Elasticsearch or data that is
sent from some other source via an API. <em>Datafeeds</em> retrieve data from Elasticsearch
for analysis, which is the simpler and more common scenario.</p>
<p>You can associate only one datafeed with each anomaly detection job. The datafeed contains
a query that runs at a defined interval (<code class="literal">frequency</code>). By default, this interval
is calculated relative to the <a class="xref" href="ml-buckets.html" title="Buckets">bucket span</a> of the anomaly detection job.
If you are concerned about delayed data, you can add a delay before the query
runs at each interval. See <a class="xref" href="ml-delayed-data-detection.html" title="Handling delayed data">Handling delayed data</a>.</p>
<p>Datafeeds can also aggregate data before sending it to the anomaly detection job.
There are some limitations, however, and aggregations should generally be used
only for low cardinality data. See <a class="xref" href="ml-configuring-aggregation.html" title="Aggregating data for faster performance">Aggregating data for faster performance</a>.</p>
<p>If you create anomaly detection jobs in Kibana, you <em>must</em> use datafeeds. When you create
an anomaly detection job, you select an index pattern and Kibana configures the datafeed
for you under the covers. For a description of all the datafeed properties, see
the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/ml-put-datafeed.html" class="ulink" target="_top">create datafeeds API</a>.</p>
<p>To start retrieving data from Elasticsearch, you must start the datafeed. When you start
it, you can optionally specify start and end times. If you do not specify an
end time, the datafeed runs continuously. Datafeeds with an end time close
their corresponding jobs when they are stopped. For this reason, when historical
data is analysed, there is no need to stop the datafeed and/or close the job as
they are stopped and closed automatically when the end time is reached. However,
when a datafeed without an end time is stopped, it does not close the
corresponding job automatically. You can start and stop datafeeds in Kibana or use
the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/ml-start-datafeed.html" class="ulink" target="_top">start datafeeds</a> and
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/ml-stop-datafeed.html" class="ulink" target="_top">stop datafeeds</a> APIs. A datafeed can be started and
stopped multiple times throughout its lifecycle.</p>
<div class="important admon">

<div class="admon_content">
<p>When the Elasticsearch security features are enabled, a datafeed stores the roles of the
user who created or updated the datafeed at that time. This means that if those
roles are updated, the datafeed subsequently runs with the new permissions that
are associated with the roles. However, if the user’s roles are adjusted after
creating or updating the datafeed, the datafeed continues to run with the
permissions that were associated with the original roles.</p>
<p>One way to update the roles that are stored within the datafeed without changing
any other settings is to submit an empty JSON document ({}) to the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/ml-update-datafeed.html" class="ulink" target="_top">update datafeed API</a>.</p>

<p>If the data that you want to analyze is not stored in Elasticsearch, you cannot use
datafeeds. You can however send batches of data directly to the job by using the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/ml-post-data.html" class="ulink" target="_top">post data to jobs API</a>. <span class="Admonishment Admonishment--change">
