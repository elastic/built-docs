<p>The machine learning features analyze the input stream of data, model its behavior, and
perform analysis based on the detectors in each job. When an event occurs
outside of the model, that event is identified as an anomaly. You can
immediately see that all three jobs have found anomalies, which are indicated by
red blocks in the swim lanes for each job.</p>
<p>There are two tools for examining the results from anomaly detection jobs in Kibana: the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span> and the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span>. You can switch between
these tools by clicking the icons in the top left corner. You can also edit the
job selection to examine a different subset of anomaly detection jobs.</p>
<h3><a id="ml-gs-results-smv"></a>Single metric job results<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.17/docs/en/stack/ml/get-started/ml-gs-results.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>One of the sample jobs (<code class="literal">low_request_rate</code>), is a <em>single metric anomaly detection job</em>.
It has a single detector that uses the <code class="literal">low_count</code> function and limited job
properties. You might use a job like this if you want to determine when the
request rate on your web site drops significantly.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by looking at this simple job in the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Select the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Detection</strong></span> tab in <span class="strong strong"><strong>Machine Learning</strong></span> to see the list of your
anomaly detection jobs.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Click the chart icon in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Actions</strong></span> column for your <code class="literal">low_request_rate</code> job
to view its results in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span>.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job1-analysis.jpg" alt="Single Metric Viewer for low_request_rate job">
</div>
</div>
<p>This view contains a chart that represents the actual and expected values over
time. It is available only if the job has <code class="literal">model_plot_config</code> enabled. It can
display only a single time series.</p>
<p>The blue line in the chart represents the actual data values. The shaded blue
area represents the bounds for the expected values. The area between the upper
and lower bounds are the most likely values for the model, using a 95%
confidence level. That is to say, there is a 95% chance of the actual value
falling within these bounds. If a value is outside of this area then it will usually
be identified as anomalous.</p>
<p>If you slide the time selector from the beginning to the end of the data, you
can see how the model improves as it processes more data. At the beginning, the
expected range of values is pretty broad and the model is not capturing the
periodicity in the data. But it quickly learns and begins to reflect the
patterns in your data.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div>
<p class="title"><strong>Anomaly scores</strong></p>
</div></div></div>
<p>Any data points outside the range that was predicted by the model are marked
as anomalies. In order to provide a sensible view of the results, an
<em>anomaly score</em> is calculated for each bucket time interval. The anomaly score
is a value from 0 to 100, which indicates the significance of the anomaly
compared to previously seen anomalies. The highly anomalous values are shown in
red and the low scored values are indicated in blue. An interval with a high
anomaly score is significant and requires investigation.</p>
</div>
<p>Slide the time selector to a section of the time series that contains a red
anomaly data point. If you hover over the point, you can see more information.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>You might notice a high spike in the time series. It&#8217;s not highlighted as
an anomaly, however, since this job looks for low counts only.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For each anomaly, you can see key details such as the time, the actual and
expected ("typical") values, and their probability in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomalies</strong></span> section
of the viewer. For example:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job1-anomalies.jpg" alt="Single Metric Viewer Anomalies for low_request_rate job">
</div>
</div>
<p>In the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Actions</strong></span> column, there are additional options, such as <span class="strong strong"><strong>Raw data</strong></span> which
generates a query for the relevant documents in <span class="strong strong"><strong>Discover</strong></span>. You can optionally
add more links in the actions menu with <a class="xref" href="ml-configuring-url.html" title="Adding custom URLs to machine learning results">custom URLs</a>.</p>
<p>By default, the table contains all anomalies that have a severity of "warning"
or higher in the selected section of the timeline. If you are only interested in
critical anomalies, for example, you can change the severity threshold for this
table.</p>
<p>You can optionally annotate your job results by drag-selecting a period of time
in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span> and adding a description. Annotations are notes
that refer to events in a specific time period. They can be created by the
user or generated automatically by the anomaly detection job to reflect model changes
and noteworthy occurrences.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-user-annotation.jpg" alt="A user annotation in the Single Metric Viewer">
</div>
</div>
<p>After you have identified anomalies, often the next step is to try to determine
the context of those situations. For example, are there other factors that are
contributing to the problem? Are the anomalies confined to particular
applications or servers? You can begin to troubleshoot these situations by
layering additional jobs or creating multi-metric jobs.</p>
<h3><a id="ml-gs-results-ae"></a>Advanced or multi-metric job results<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.17/docs/en/stack/ml/get-started/ml-gs-results.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Conceptually, you can think of <em>multi-metric anomaly detection jobs</em> as running multiple
independent single metric jobs. By bundling them together in a multi-metric job,
however, you can see an overall score and shared influencers for all the metrics
and all the entities in the job. Multi-metric jobs therefore scale better than
having many independent single metric jobs. They also provide better results
when you have influencers that are shared across the detectors.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div>
<p class="title"><strong>Influencers</strong></p>
</div></div></div>
<p>When you create an anomaly detection job, you can identify fields as <em>influencers</em>.
These are fields that you think contain information about someone or something
that influences or contributes to anomalies. There are influencers in both the
<code class="literal">response_code_rates</code> and <code class="literal">url_scanning</code> jobs.</p>
<p>As a best practice, do not pick too many influencers. For example, you generally
do not need more than three. If you pick many influencers, the results can be
overwhelming and there is a small overhead to the analysis. For more details,
see <a class="xref" href="ml-influencers.html" title="Influencers">Influencers</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>You can also configure your anomaly detection jobs to split a single time series into
multiple time series based on a categorical field. For example, the
<code class="literal">response_code_rates</code> job has a single detector that splits the data based on
the <code class="literal">response.keyword</code> and then uses the <code class="literal">count</code> function to determine when the
number of events is anomalous. You might use a job like this if you want to
look at both high and low request rates partitioned by response code.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by looking at the <code class="literal">response_code_rates</code> job in the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Select the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Detection</strong></span> tab in <span class="strong strong"><strong>Machine Learning</strong></span> to see the list of your
anomaly detection jobs.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Click the grid icon in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Actions</strong></span> column for your <code class="literal">response_code_rates</code> job
to view its results in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span>.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>For this particular job, you can choose to see separate swim lanes for each client
IP or response code. For example:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job2-explorer.jpg" alt="Anomaly explorer for response_code_rates job">
</div>
</div>
<p>Since the job uses <code class="literal">response.keyword</code> as its <em>partition field</em>, the analysis is
segmented such that you have completely different baselines for each distinct
value of that field. By looking at temporal patterns on a per entity basis, you
might spot things that might have otherwise been hidden in the lumped view.</p>
<p>Under the anomaly timeline, there is a section that contains annotations. You
can filter the type of events by using the selector on the right side of the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Annotations</strong></span> section.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-annotations.jpg" alt="Annotations section in the Anomaly Explorer">
</div>
</div>
<p>On the left side of the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span>, there is a list of the top
influencers for all of the detected anomalies in that same time period. The list
includes maximum anomaly scores, which in this case are aggregated for each
influencer, for each bucket, across all detectors. There is also a total sum of
the anomaly scores for each influencer. You can use this list to help you narrow
down the contributing factors and focus on the most anomalous entities.</p>
<p>Click on a section in the swim lanes to obtain more information about the
anomalies in that time period. For example, click on the red section in the
swim lane for the <code class="literal">response.keyword</code> value of <code class="literal">404</code>:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job2-explorer-anomaly.jpg" alt="Anomaly charts for the response_code_rates job">
</div>
</div>
<p>You can see exact times when anomalies occurred. If there are multiple detectors
or metrics in the job, you can see which caught the anomaly. You can also switch
to viewing this time series in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Below the charts, there is a table that provides more information, such as the
typical and actual values and the influencers that contributed to the anomaly.
For example:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job2-explorer-table.jpg" alt="Anomaly tables for the response_code_rates job">
</div>
</div>
<p>If your job has multiple detectors, the table aggregates the anomalies to show
the highest severity anomaly per detector and entity, which is the field value
that is displayed in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>found for</strong></span> column. To view all the anomalies without
any aggregation, set the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Interval</strong></span> to <code class="literal">Show all</code>.</p>
<p>In this sample data, the spike in the 404 response codes is influenced by a
specific client. Situations like this might indicate that the client is
accessing unusual pages or scanning your site to see if they can access
unusual URLs. This anomalous behavior merits further investigation.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The anomaly scores that you see in each section of the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span>
might differ slightly. This disparity occurs because for each job there are
bucket results, influencer results, and record results. Anomaly scores are
generated for each type of result. The anomaly timeline uses the bucket-level
anomaly scores. The list of top influencers uses the influencer-level anomaly
scores. The list of anomalies uses the record-level anomaly scores.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><a id="ml-gs-results-population"></a>Population job results<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.17/docs/en/stack/ml/get-started/ml-gs-results.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The final sample job (<code class="literal">url_scanning</code>) is a <em>population anomaly detection job</em>. As we
saw in the <code class="literal">response_code_rates</code> job results, there are some clients that seem
to be accessing unusually high numbers of URLs. The <code class="literal">url_scanning</code> sample job
provides another method for investigating that type of problem. It has a
single detector that uses the <code class="literal">high_distinct_count</code> function on the <code class="literal">url.keyword</code>
to detect unusually high numbers of distinct values in that field. It then
analyzes whether that behavior differs over the population of clients, as
defined by the <code class="literal">clientip</code> field.</p>
<p>If you examine the results from the <code class="literal">url_scanning</code> anomaly detection job in the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span>, you&#8217;ll notice its charts have a different format. For
example:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job3-explorer.jpg" alt="Anomaly charts for the url_scanning job">
</div>
</div>
<p>In this case, the metrics for each client IP are analyzed relative to other
client IPs in each bucket and we can once again see that the
<code class="literal">30.156.16.164</code> client IP is behaving abnormally.</p>
<p>If you want to play with another example of a population anomaly detection job, add the
sample eCommerce orders data set. Its <code class="literal">high_sum_total_sales</code> job determines
which customers have made unusual amounts of purchases relative to other
customers in each bucket of time. In this example, there are anomalous events
found for two customers:</p>
