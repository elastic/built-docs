<h3><a id="ml-analyzing"></a>Analyzing the past and present<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.17/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The machine learning features automate the analysis of time series data by creating
accurate baselines of normal behavior in the data and identifying anomalous
patterns in that data. You can submit your data for analysis in batches or
continuously in real-time datafeeds.</p>
<p>Using <a class="xref" href="ml-overview.html#anomaly-algorithms" title="Anomaly detection algorithms">proprietary machine learning algorithms</a>, the following
circumstances are detected, scored, and linked with statistically significant
influencers in the data:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Anomalies related to temporal deviations in values, counts, or frequencies
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Statistical rarity
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Unusual behaviors for a member of a population
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Automated periodicity detection and quick adaptation to changing data ensure
that you don’t need to specify algorithms, models, or other data science-related
configurations in order to get the benefits of machine learning.</p>
<p>You can view the machine learning results in Kibana where, for example, charts illustrate the
actual data values, the bounds for the expected values, and the anomalies that
occur outside these bounds.</p>

<h3><a id="ml-forecasting"></a>Forecasting the future<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.17/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-overview.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>After the machine learning features create baselines of normal behavior for your data,
you can use that information to extrapolate future behavior.</p>
<p>You can use a forecast to estimate a time series value at a specific future date.
For example, you might want to determine how many users you can expect to visit
your website next Sunday at 0900.</p>
<p>You can also use it to estimate the probability of a time series value occurring
at a future date. For example, you might want to determine how likely it is that
your disk utilization will reach 100% before the end of next week.</p>
<p>Each forecast has a unique ID, which you can use to distinguish between forecasts
that you created at different times. You can create a forecast by using the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/ml-forecast.html" class="ulink" target="_top">forecast anomaly detection jobs API</a> or by using Kibana. For
example:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/overview-forecast.jpg" alt="Example screenshot from the Machine Learning Single Metric Viewer in Kibana">
</div>
</div>
<p>The yellow line in the chart represents the predicted data values. The
shaded yellow area represents the bounds for the predicted values, which also
gives an indication of the confidence of the predictions.</p>
<p>When you create a forecast, you specify its <em>duration</em>, which indicates how far
the forecast extends beyond the last record that was processed. By default, the
duration is 1 day. Typically the farther into the future that you forecast, the
lower the confidence levels become (that is to say, the bounds increase).
Eventually if the confidence levels are too low, the forecast stops.
For more information about limitations that affect your ability to create a
forecast, see <a class="xref" href="ml-limitations.html#ml-forecast-config-limitations" title="Unsupported forecast configurations">Unsupported forecast configurations</a>.</p>
<p>You can also optionally specify when the forecast expires. By default, it
expires in 14 days and is deleted automatically thereafter. You can specify a
different expiration period by using the <code class="literal">expires_in</code> parameter in the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/ml-forecast.html" class="ulink" target="_top">forecast anomaly detection jobs API</a>.</p>

<p>The anomaly detection machine learning features use a bespoke amalgamation of different
techniques such as clustering, various types of time series decomposition,
Bayesian distribution modeling, and correlation analysis. These analytics
provide sophisticated real-time automated anomaly detection for time series data.</p>
<p>The machine learning analytics statistically model the time-based characteristics of your
data by observing historical behavior and adapting to new data. The model
represents a baseline of normal behavior and can therefore be used to determine
how anomalous new events are.</p>
<p>Anomaly detection results are written for each <a class="xref" href="ml-buckets.html" title="Buckets">bucket span</a>.
These results include scores that are aggregated in order to reduce noise and
normalized in order to rank the most mathematically significant anomalies. For
more information, see <a class="xref" href="ml-buckets.html#ml-bucket-results" title="Bucket results">Bucket results</a> and <a class="xref" href="ml-influencers.html#ml-influencer-results" title="Influencer results">Influencer results</a>.</p>
