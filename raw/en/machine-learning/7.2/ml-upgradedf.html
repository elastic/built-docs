<p>This problem occurs when you have a datafeed that contains search or query
domain specific language (DSL) that was discontinued. For example, if you
created a datafeed query in 5.x using search syntax that was deprecated in 5.x
and removed in 6.0, you must fix the datafeed before you upgrade to 6.0.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Symptoms:</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
If <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.2/logging.html#deprecation-logging" class="ulink" target="_top">deprecation logging</a> is enabled
before the upgrade, deprecation messages are generated when the datafeeds attempt
to retrieve data.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
After the upgrade, nodes fail to start and the error indicates that they
failed to read the local state.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Resolution:</strong></span></p>
<p>Before you upgrade, identify the problematic search or query DSL. In 5.6.5 and
later, the Upgrade Assistant detects these scenarios. If you cannot fix the DSL
before the upgrade, you must delete the datafeed then re-create it with valid DSL
after the upgrade.</p>
<p>If you do not fix or delete the datafeed before the upgrade, in order to successfully
start the failing nodes you must downgrade the nodes then fix the problem per
above.</p>
