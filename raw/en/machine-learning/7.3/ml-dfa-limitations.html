<p>This functionality is experimental and may be changed or removed completely in a future release. Elastic will take a best effort approach to fix any issues, but experimental features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.</p>

<p>The following limitations and known problems apply to the 7.3 release of
the Elastic data frame analytics feature:</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-ccs-limitations"></a>Cross-cluster search is not supported<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.3/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Cross-cluster search is not supported in 7.3 for data frame analytics.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-deletion-limitations"></a>Deleting a data frame analytics job does not delete the destination index<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.3/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/delete-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">delete data frame analytics job API</a> does not delete
the destination index that contains the annotated data of the data frame analytics.
That index must be deleted separately.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-update-limitations"></a>Data frame analytics jobs cannot be updated<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.3/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You cannot update Data frame analytics configurations. Instead, delete the
data frame analytics job and create a new one.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-dataframe-size-limitations"></a>Data frame memory limitation<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.3/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Data frame analytics can analyze data frames that fit into the memory limit
dedicated for machine learning processes. For general machine learning settings, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/ml-settings.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Machine learning settings in Elasticsearch</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-field-limitations"></a>Field limitations in data frame analytics<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.3/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Currently, outlier detection only supports numeric features. Non-numeric fields will
be excluded from the analysis by default. If such a field is explicitly included
in the analysis, starting the data frame analytics should result in failure. Arrays are
not supported either. Documents that contain analyzed fields with unsupported
values will be skipped entirely.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-missing-fields-limitations"></a>Documents with missing values in analyzed fields are skipped<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.3/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If there are missing values in feature fields (fields that are subjects of the
data frame analytics), then the document that contains the fields with the missing
values will be skipped during the analysis.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-od-field-type-docs-limitations"></a>Outlier detection field types<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.3/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Outlier detection requires numeric or boolean data to analyze. The algorithms
don&#8217;t support missing values (see also <a class="xref" href="ml-dfa-limitations.html#dfa-missing-fields-limitations" title="Documents with missing values in analyzed fields are skipped">Documents with missing values in analyzed fields are skipped</a>),
therefore fields that have data types other than numeric or boolean are ignored.
Documents where included fields contain missing values, null values, or an array
are also ignored. Therefore a destination index may contain documents that don&#8217;t
have an outlier score. These documents are still reindexed from the source index to
the destination index, but they are not included in the outlier detection analysis
and therefore no outlier score is computed.</p>
