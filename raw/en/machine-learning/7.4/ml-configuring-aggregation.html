<p>By default, datafeeds fetch data from Elasticsearch using search and scroll requests.
It can be significantly more efficient, however, to aggregate data in Elasticsearch
and to configure your anomaly detection jobs to analyze aggregated data.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of aggregating data this way is that Elasticsearch automatically
distributes these calculations across your cluster. You can then feed this
aggregated data into the machine learning features instead of raw results, which
reduces the volume of data that must be considered while detecting anomalies.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to using aggregations in datafeeds, however.
Your aggregation must include a <code class="literal">date_histogram</code> aggregation, which in turn must
contain a <code class="literal">max</code> aggregation on the time field. This requirement ensures that the
aggregated data is a time series and the timestamp of each bucket is the time
of the last record in the bucket. If you use a terms aggregation and the
cardinality of a term is high, then the aggregation might not be effective and
you might want to just use the default search and scroll behavior.</p>
<p>When you create or update an anomaly detection job, you can include the names of
aggregations, for example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT _ml/anomaly_detectors/farequote
{
  "analysis_config": {
    "bucket_span": "60m",
    "detectors": [{
      "function": "mean",
      "field_name": "responsetime",
      "by_field_name": "airline"
    }],
    "summary_count_field_name": "doc_count"
  },
  "data_description": {
    "time_field":"time"
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/14.console"></div>
<p>In this example, the <code class="literal">airline</code>, <code class="literal">responsetime</code>, and <code class="literal">time</code> fields are
aggregations.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>When the <code class="literal">summary_count_field_name</code> property is set to a non-null value,
the job expects to receive aggregated input. The property must be set to the
name of the field that contains the count of raw data points that have been
aggregated. It applies to all detectors in the job.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The aggregations are defined in the datafeed as follows:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT _ml/datafeeds/datafeed-farequote
{
  "job_id":"farequote",
  "indices": ["farequote"],
  "aggregations": {
    "buckets": {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field": "time",
        "fixed_interval": "360s",
        "time_zone": "UTC"
      },
      "aggregations": {
        "time": {
          "max": {"field": "time"}
        },
        "airline": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "airline",
            "size": 100
          },
          "aggregations": {
            "responsetime": {
              "avg": {
                "field": "responsetime"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/15.console"></div>
<p>In this example, the aggregations have names that match the fields that they
operate on. That is to say, the <code class="literal">max</code> aggregation is named <code class="literal">time</code> and its
field is also <code class="literal">time</code>. The same is true for the aggregations with the names
<code class="literal">airline</code> and <code class="literal">responsetime</code>. Since you must create the job before you can
create the datafeed, synchronizing your aggregation and field names can simplify
these configuration steps.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If you use a <code class="literal">max</code> aggregation on a time field, the aggregation name
in the datafeed must match the name of the time field, as in the previous example.
For all other aggregations, if the aggregation name doesn&#8217;t match the field name,
there are limitations in the drill-down functionality within the machine learning page in
Kibana.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Datafeeds support complex nested aggregations, this example uses the <code class="literal">derivative</code>
pipeline aggregation to find the first order derivative of the counter
<code class="literal">system.network.out.bytes</code> for each value of the field <code class="literal">beat.name</code>.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">"aggregations": {
  "beat.name": {
    "terms": {
      "field": "beat.name"
    },
    "aggregations": {
      "buckets": {
        "date_histogram": {
          "field": "@timestamp",
          "fixed_interval": "5m"
        },
        "aggregations": {
          "@timestamp": {
            "max": {
              "field": "@timestamp"
            }
          },
          "bytes_out_average": {
            "avg": {
              "field": "system.network.out.bytes"
            }
          },
          "bytes_out_derivative": {
            "derivative": {
              "buckets_path": "bytes_out_average"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>Datafeeds not only supports multi-bucket aggregations, but also single bucket aggregations.
The following shows two <code class="literal">filter</code> aggregations, each gathering the number of unique entries for
the <code class="literal">error</code> field.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">{
  "job_id":"servers-unique-errors",

              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>When you define an aggregation in a datafeed, it must have the following form:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">"aggregations": {
  ["bucketing_aggregation": {
    "bucket_agg": {
      ...
    },
    "aggregations": {]
      "data_histogram_aggregation": {
        "date_histogram": {
          "field": "time",
        },
        "aggregations": {
          "timestamp": {
            "max": {
              "field": "time"
            }
          },
          [,"&lt;first_term&gt;": {
            "terms":{...
            }
            [,"aggregations" : {
              [&lt;sub_aggregation&gt;]+
            } ]
          }]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>The top level aggregation must be either a <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/search-aggregations-bucket.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Bucket Aggregation</a>
containing as single sub-aggregation that is a <code class="literal">date_histogram</code> or the top level aggregation
is the required <code class="literal">date_histogram</code>. There must be exactly 1 <code class="literal">date_histogram</code> aggregation.
For more information, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Date Histogram Aggregation</a>.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The <code class="literal">time_zone</code> parameter in the date histogram aggregation must be set to <code class="literal">UTC</code>,
which is the default value.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Each histogram bucket has a key, which is the bucket start time. This key cannot
be used for aggregations in datafeeds, however, because they need to know the
time of the latest record within a bucket. Otherwise, when you restart a datafeed,
it continues from the start time of the histogram bucket and possibly fetches
the same data twice. The max aggregation for the time field is therefore
necessary to provide the time of the latest record within a bucket.</p>
<p>You can optionally specify a terms aggregation, which creates buckets for
different values of a field.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If you use a terms aggregation, by default it returns buckets for
the top ten terms. Thus if the cardinality of the term is greater than 10, not
all terms are analyzed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can change this behavior by setting the <code class="literal">size</code> parameter. To
determine the cardinality of your data, you can run searches such as:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-js">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">GET .../_search {
  "aggs": {
    "service_cardinality": {
      "cardinality": {
        "field": "service"
        }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>By default, Elasticsearch limits the maximum number of terms returned to 10000. For high
cardinality fields, the query might not run. It might return errors related to
circuit breaking exceptions that indicate that the data is too large. In such
cases, do not use aggregations in your datafeed. For more
information, see <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Terms Aggregation</a>.</p>
<p>You can also optionally specify multiple sub-aggregations.
The sub-aggregations are aggregated for the buckets that were created by their
parent aggregation. For more information, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.4/search-aggregations.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Aggregations</a>.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If your detectors use metric or sum analytical functions, set the
<code class="literal">interval</code> of the date histogram aggregation to a tenth of the <code class="literal">bucket_span</code>
that was defined in the job. This suggestion creates finer, more granular time
buckets, which are ideal for this type of analysis. If your detectors use count
or rare functions, set <code class="literal">interval</code> to the same value as <code class="literal">bucket_span</code>. For more
information about analytical functions, see <a class="xref" href="ml-functions.html" title="Function reference"><em>Function reference</em></a>.</p>
