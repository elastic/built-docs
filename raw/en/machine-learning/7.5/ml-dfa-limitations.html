<p>This functionality is experimental and may be changed or removed completely in a future release. Elastic will take a best effort approach to fix any issues, but experimental features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.</p>

<p>The following limitations and known problems apply to the 7.5.2 release of
the Elastic data frame analytics feature:</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-ccs-limitations"></a>Cross-cluster search is not supported<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Cross-cluster search is not supported for data frame analytics.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-deletion-limitations"></a>Deleting a data frame analytics job does not delete the destination index<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/delete-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">delete data frame analytics job API</a> does not delete
the destination index that contains the annotated data of the data frame analytics.
That index must be deleted separately.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-update-limitations"></a>Data frame analytics jobs cannot be updated<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You cannot update Data frame analytics configurations. Instead, delete the
data frame analytics job and create a new one.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-dataframe-size-limitations"></a>Data frame memory limitation<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Data frame analytics can analyze data frames that fit into the memory limit
dedicated for machine learning processes. For general machine learning settings, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/ml-settings.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Machine learning settings in Elasticsearch</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-time-limitations"></a>Data frame analytics jobs runtime may vary<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The runtime of the data frame analytics jobs depends on numerous factors, such as the
number of data points in the dataset, the type of analytics, the number of
fields that are included in the analysis, the supplied
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/put-dfanalytics.html#ml-hyperparam-optimization" class="ulink" target="_top">hyperparameters</a>, the
type of analyzed fields and so on. For example, running an analysis on a dataset
with many numerical fields will take longer than running an analysis on a
dataset that contains mainly categorical fields. Hyperparameters specified by
the user also lower the runtime. For this reason, a general runtime value that
applies to all or most of the situations does not exist. The runtime of a
data frame analytics job may take from a couple of minutes up to 35 hours in extreme
cases.</p>
<p>The runtime increases with the increasing number of analyzed fields in a nearly
linear fashion. For datasets of more than 100 000 points, we recommend to start
with a low training percent and run a few data frame analytics jobs to see how the
runtime scales with the increased number of data points and how the quality of
results scales with increased training percentage.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-missing-fields-limitations"></a>Documents with missing values in analyzed fields are skipped<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If there are missing values in feature fields (fields that are subjects of the
data frame analytics), then the document that contains the fields with the missing
values will be skipped during the analysis.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-od-field-type-docs-limitations"></a>Outlier detection field types<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Outlier detection requires numeric or boolean data to analyze. The algorithms
don&#8217;t support missing values (see also <a class="xref" href="ml-dfa-limitations.html#dfa-missing-fields-limitations" title="Documents with missing values in analyzed fields are skipped">Documents with missing values in analyzed fields are skipped</a>),
therefore fields that have data types other than numeric or boolean are ignored.
Documents where included fields contain missing values, null values, or an array
are also ignored. Therefore a destination index may contain documents that don&#8217;t
have an outlier score. These documents are still reindexed from the source index to
the destination index, but they are not included in the outlier detection analysis
and therefore no outlier score is computed.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-regression-field-type-docs-limitations"></a>Regression field types<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Regression supports fields that are numeric, boolean, text, keyword and
ip. It is also tolerant of missing values. Fields that are supported are
included in the analysis, other fields are ignored. Documents where included
fields contain an array are also ignored. Documents in the destination index
that don&#8217;t contain a results field are not included in the regression analysis.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-classification-field-type-docs-limitations"></a>Classification field types<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Classification supports fields that have numeric, boolean, text, keyword,
or ip data types. It is also tolerant of missing values. Fields that are
supported are included in the analysis, other fields are ignored. Documents
where included fields contain an array are also ignored. Documents in the
destination index that don&#8217;t contain a results field are not included in the
classification analysis.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-classification-imbalanced-classes"></a>Imbalanced class sizes affect classification performance<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If your training data is very imbalanced, then classification analysis may not provide
good predictions. Training tries to mitigate the effects of imbalanced
training data by maximizing the minimum recall of any class. For imbalanced
training data, this means that it will try to balance the proportion of values
it correctly labels in the minority and majority class. However, this process
can result in a slight degradation of the overall accuracy. Try to avoid highly
imbalanced situations. We recommend having at least 50 examples of each class
and a ratio of no more than 10 to 1 for the majority to minority class labels in
the training data. If your training dataset is very imbalanced, consider
downsampling the majority class, upsampling the minority class or – if it&#8217;s
possible – gather more data. Consider investigating methods to change data that
fit your use case the most.</p>
