<p>The following limitations and known problems apply to the 7.5.2 release of
the Elastic machine learning features:</p>
<h3><a id="ml-limitations-sse"></a>CPUs must support SSE4.2<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Machine learning uses Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) 4.2 instructions, so it works only
on machines whose CPUs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#Supporting_CPUs" class="ulink" target="_top">support</a>
SSE4.2. If you run Elasticsearch on older hardware you must disable machine learning by setting
<code class="literal">xpack.ml.enabled</code> to <code class="literal">false</code>. See
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/ml-settings.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Machine learning settings in Elasticsearch</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_categorization_uses_english_dictionary_words"></a>Categorization uses English dictionary words<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Categorization identifies static parts of unstructured logs and groups similar
messages together. The default categorization tokenizer assumes English language
log messages. For other languages you must define a different
<code class="literal">categorization_analyzer</code> for your job. For more information, see
<a class="xref" href="ml-configuring-categories.html" title="Categorizing log messages">Categorizing log messages</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a dictionary used to influence the categorization process contains
only English words. This means categorization might work better in English than
in other languages. The ability to customize the dictionary will be added in a
future release.</p>
<h3><a id="_pop_ups_must_be_enabled_in_browsers"></a>Pop-ups must be enabled in browsers<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The machine learning features in Kibana use pop-ups. You must configure your
web browser so that it does not block pop-up windows or create an
exception for your Kibana URL.</p>
<h3><a id="_anomaly_explorer_omissions_and_limitations"></a>Anomaly Explorer omissions and limitations<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In Kibana, Anomaly Explorer charts are not displayed for anomalies
that were due to categorization, <code class="literal">time_of_day</code> functions, or <code class="literal">time_of_week</code>
functions. Those particular results do not display well as time series
charts.</p>
<p>The charts are also not displayed for detectors that use script fields. In that
case, the original source data cannot be easily searched because it has been
somewhat transformed by the script.</p>
<p>The Anomaly Explorer charts can also look odd in circumstances where there
is very little data to plot. For example, if there is only one data point, it is
represented as a single dot. If there are only two data points, they are joined
by a line.</p>
<h3><a id="_jobs_close_on_the_datafeed_end_date"></a>Jobs close on the datafeed end date<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If you start a datafeed and specify an end date, it will close the job when
the datafeed stops. This behavior avoids having numerous open one-time jobs.</p>
<p>If you do not specify an end date when you start a datafeed, the job
remains open when you stop the datafeed. This behavior avoids the overhead
of closing and re-opening large jobs when there are pauses in the datafeed.</p>
<h3><a id="_jobs_created_in_kibana_must_use_datafeeds"></a>Jobs created in Kibana must use datafeeds<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If you create jobs in Kibana, you must use datafeeds. If the data that you want to
analyze is not stored in Elasticsearch, you cannot use datafeeds and therefore you cannot
create your jobs in Kibana. You can, however, use the machine learning APIs to create jobs
and to send batches of data directly to the jobs. For more information, see
<a class="xref" href="ml-dfeeds.html" title="Datafeeds">Datafeeds</a> and <a class="xref" href="ml-api-quickref.html" title="API quick reference"><em>API quick reference</em></a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_post_data_api_requires_json_format"></a>Post data API requires JSON format<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The post data API enables you to send data to a job for analysis. The data that
you send to the job must use the JSON format.</p>
<p>For more information about this API, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/ml-post-data.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Post Data to Jobs</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_misleading_high_missing_field_counts"></a>Misleading high missing field counts<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>One of the counts associated with a machine learning job is <code class="literal">missing_field_count</code>,
which indicates the number of records that are missing a configured field.</p>
<p>Since jobs analyze JSON data, the <code class="literal">missing_field_count</code> might be misleading.
Missing fields might be expected due to the structure of the data and therefore
do not generate poor results.</p>
<p>For more information about <code class="literal">missing_field_count</code>,
see the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/ml-get-job-stats.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get anomaly detection job statistics API</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_terms_aggregation_size_affects_data_analysis"></a>Terms aggregation size affects data analysis<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>By default, the <code class="literal">terms</code> aggregation returns the buckets for the top ten terms.
You can change this default behavior by setting the <code class="literal">size</code> parameter.</p>
<p>If you are send pre-aggregated data to a job for analysis, you must ensure
that the <code class="literal">size</code> is configured correctly. Otherwise, some data might not be
analyzed.</p>
<h3><a id="_fields_named_by_count_or_over_cannot_be_used_to_split_data"></a>Fields named "by", "count", or "over" cannot be used to split data<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You cannot use the following field names in the <code class="literal">by_field_name</code> or
<code class="literal">over_field_name</code> properties in a job: <code class="literal">by</code>; <code class="literal">count</code>; <code class="literal">over</code>. This limitation
also applies to those properties when you create advanced jobs in Kibana.</p>
<h3><a id="_jobs_created_in_kibana_use_model_plot_config_and_pre_aggregated_data"></a>Jobs created in Kibana use model plot config and pre-aggregated data<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If you create single or multi-metric jobs in Kibana, it might enable some
options under the covers that you&#8217;d want to reconsider for large or
long-running jobs.</p>
<p>For example, when you create a single metric job in Kibana, it generally
enables the <code class="literal">model_plot_config</code> advanced configuration option. That configuration
option causes model information to be stored along with the results and provides
a more detailed view into anomaly detection. It is specifically used by the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span> in Kibana. When this option is enabled, however, it can
add considerable overhead to the performance of the system. If you have jobs
with many entities, for example data from tens of thousands of servers, storing
this additional model information for every bucket might be problematic. If you
are not certain that you need this option or if you experience performance
issues, edit your job configuration to disable this option.</p>
<p>Likewise, when you create a single or multi-metric job in Kibana, in some cases
it uses aggregations on the data that it retrieves from Elasticsearch. One of the
benefits of summarizing data this way is that Elasticsearch automatically distributes
these calculations across your cluster. This summarized data is then fed into
machine learning instead of raw results, which reduces the volume of data that must
be considered while detecting anomalies.  However, if you have two jobs, one of
which uses pre-aggregated data and another that does not, their results might
differ. This difference is due to the difference in precision of the input data.
The machine learning analytics are designed to be aggregation-aware and the likely increase
in performance that is gained by pre-aggregating the data makes the potentially
poorer precision worthwhile. If you want to view or change the aggregations
that are used in your job, refer to the <code class="literal">aggregations</code> property in your datafeed.</p>
<h3><a id="_security_integration"></a>Security integration<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When the Elasticsearch security features are enabled, a datafeed stores the roles of the
user who created or updated the datafeed <span class="strong strong"><strong>at that time</strong></span>. This means that if those
roles are updated then the datafeed subsequently runs with the new permissions
that are associated with the roles. However, if the user&#8217;s roles are adjusted
after creating or updating the datafeed, the datafeed continues to run with the
permissions that were associated with the original roles. For more information,
see <a class="xref" href="ml-dfeeds.html" title="Datafeeds">Datafeeds</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_jobs_must_be_stopped_before_upgrades"></a>Jobs must be stopped before upgrades<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You must stop any machine learning jobs that are running before you start the upgrade
process. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="stopping-ml.html" title="Stop machine learning anomaly detection">Stop machine learning anomaly detection</a> and
<a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack/7.5/upgrading-elastic-stack.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrading the Elastic Stack</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_rollup_indices_and_index_patterns_are_not_supported"></a>Rollup indices and index patterns are not supported<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Rollup indices and index patterns cannot be used in machine learning jobs or
datafeeds. This limitation applies irrespective of whether you create the jobs in
Kibana or by using APIs. In Kibana, if you select an index, saved search, or index
pattern that uses the Rollup feature, the machine learning job creation wizards fail.</p>
<p>See <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/xpack-rollup.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Rolling up historical data</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="ml-space-limitations"></a>Machine learning objects do not belong to Kibana spaces<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If you create <a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.5/xpack-spaces.html" class="ulink" target="_top">spaces</a> in Kibana, you see only the
saved objects that belong to that space. This limited scope does not apply to
machine learning objects; they are visible in all of your spaces.</p>
<p>However, the Kibana machine learning features interact with some saved objects (such as
index patterns, dashboards, and visualizations) that might not be available in
all spaces. For example:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="Admonishment Admonishment--preview">
[<span class="Admonishment-title u-mono">preview</span>]
<span class="Admonishment-detail">
This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will apply best effort to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
</span>
</span> If you upload a file on the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Machine Learning</strong></span> page in Kibana,
the machine learning features identify the file format and field mappings. You can then
optionally import that data into an Elasticsearch index and create an index pattern. This
index pattern belongs to the space that is active when you import the file. If
you want to use the index pattern in other spaces, you must create it as needed.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Likewise, if you use the single-metric, multi-metric, or population job
wizards to create a job in Kibana, you can encounter problems if you subsequently
try to clone the job in a different space. In particular, problems occur when
you try to clone the job in a space that does not contain appropriate index
patterns.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you used a supplied configuration to create jobs (for example, for Apache
or NGINX web access logs), visualizations and dashboards are automatically
generated. These objects belong to the space that was active when you created
the job. If you change your active space, custom URLs from the machine learning results to
the dashboards or visualizations might fail.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a id="ml-result-size-limitations"></a>Job and datafeed APIs have a maximum search size<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In 6.6 and later releases, the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/ml-get-job.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get jobs API</a> and the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/ml-get-job-stats.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get job statistics API</a> return a maximum of 10,000
jobs. Likewise, the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/ml-get-datafeed.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get datafeeds API</a> and the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/ml-get-datafeed-stats.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get datafeed statistics API</a> return a maximum of
10,000 datafeeds.</p>
<h3><a id="ml-limitations-nanos"></a>Date nanoseconds data types are not supported<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When you create an anomaly detection job, you cannot use a field with the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/date_nanos.html" class="ulink" target="_top"><code class="literal">date_nanos</code> data type</a> as the <code class="literal">time_field</code> in the
<code class="literal">data_description</code> object. This limitation applies irrespective of whether you
create jobs in Kibana or by using APIs.</p>
<h3><a id="ml-forecast-limitations"></a>Forecast limitations<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>There are some limitations that affect your ability to create a forecast:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
You can generate only three forecasts concurrently. There is no limit to the
number of forecasts that you retain. Existing forecasts are not overwritten when
you create new forecasts. Rather, they are automatically deleted when they expire.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If you use an <code class="literal">over_field_name</code> property in your anomaly detection job (that is to say,
it&#8217;s a <em>population job</em>), you cannot create a forecast.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>If you use any of the following analytical functions in your anomaly detection job,
you cannot create a forecast:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">lat_long</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">rare</code> and <code class="literal">freq_rare</code>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><code class="literal">time_of_day</code> and <code class="literal">time_of_week</code></p>
<p>For more information about any of these functions, see <a class="xref" href="ml-functions.html" title="Function reference"><em>Function reference</em></a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Forecasts run concurrently with real-time machine learning analysis. That is to say, machine learning
analysis does not stop while forecasts are generated. Forecasts can have an
impact on anomaly detection jobs, however, especially in terms of memory usage. For this
reason, forecasts run only if the model memory status is acceptable.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The anomaly detection job must be open when you create a forecast. Otherwise, an error
occurs.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If there is insufficient data to generate any meaningful predictions, an
error occurs. In general, forecasts that are created early in the learning phase
of the data analysis are less accurate.
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="ml-frozen-limitations"></a>Frozen indices are not supported<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.5/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/frozen-indices.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Frozen indices</a> cannot be used in anomaly detection jobs or
datafeeds. This limitation applies irrespective of whether you create the jobs in
