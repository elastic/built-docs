<p>The following limitations and known problems apply to the 7.6.2 release of
the Elastic data frame analytics feature:</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-ccs-limitations"></a>Cross-cluster search is not supported<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Cross-cluster search is not supported for data frame analytics.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-deletion-limitations"></a>Deleting a data frame analytics job does not delete the destination index<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/delete-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">delete data frame analytics job API</a> does not delete
the destination index that contains the annotated data of the data frame analytics.
That index must be deleted separately.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-update-limitations"></a>Data frame analytics jobs cannot be updated<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You cannot update data frame analytics configurations. Instead, delete the
data frame analytics job and create a new one.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-dataframe-size-limitations"></a>Data frame analytics memory limitation<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Data frame analytics can only perform analyses that fit into the memory available
for machine learning. Overspill to disk is not currently possible. For general machine learning
settings, see <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/ml-settings.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Machine learning settings in Elasticsearch</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-time-limitations"></a>Data frame analytics jobs runtime may vary<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The runtime of data frame analytics jobs depends on numerous factors, such as the
number of data points in the data set, the type of analytics, the number of
fields that are included in the analysis, the supplied
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/put-dfanalytics.html#ml-hyperparam-optimization" class="ulink" target="_top">hyperparameters</a>, the
type of analyzed fields, and so on. For this reason, a general runtime value that
applies to all or most of the situations does not exist. The runtime of a
data frame analytics job may take from a couple of minutes up to 35 hours in extreme
cases.</p>
<p>The runtime increases with an increasing number of analyzed fields in a nearly
linear fashion. For data sets of more than 100,000 points, start with a low
training percent. Run a few data frame analytics jobs to see how the runtime scales
with the increased number of data points and how the quality of results scales
with an increased training percentage.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-missing-fields-limitations"></a>Documents with missing values in analyzed fields are skipped<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If there are missing values in feature fields (fields that are subjects of the
data frame analytics), the document that contains these fields is skipped
during the analysis.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-od-field-type-docs-limitations"></a>Outlier detection field types<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Outlier detection requires numeric or boolean data to analyze. The algorithms
don&#8217;t support missing values (see also <a class="xref" href="ml-dfa-limitations.html#dfa-missing-fields-limitations" title="Documents with missing values in analyzed fields are skipped">Documents with missing values in analyzed fields are skipped</a>),
therefore fields that have data types other than numeric or boolean are ignored.
Documents where included fields contain missing values, null values, or an array
are also ignored. Therefore a destination index may contain documents that don&#8217;t
have an outlier score. These documents are still reindexed from the source index to the
destination index, but they are not included in the outlier detection analysis and
therefore no outlier score is computed.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-regression-field-type-docs-limitations"></a>Regression field types<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Regression supports fields that are numeric, boolean, text, keyword and
ip. It is also tolerant of missing values. Fields that are supported are
included in the analysis, other fields are ignored. Documents where included
fields contain an array are also ignored. Documents in the destination index
that don&#8217;t contain a results field are not included in the regression analysis.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-classification-field-type-docs-limitations"></a>Classification field types<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Classification supports fields that have numeric, boolean, text, keyword,
or ip data types. It is also tolerant of missing values. Fields that are
supported are included in the analysis, other fields are ignored. Documents
where included fields contain an array are also ignored. Documents in the
destination index that don&#8217;t contain a results field are not included in the
classification analysis.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-classification-imbalanced-classes"></a>Imbalanced class sizes affect classification performance<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If your training data is very imbalanced, classification analysis may not provide
good predictions. Try to avoid highly imbalanced situations. We recommend having
at least 50 examples of each class and a ratio of no more than 10 to 1 for the
majority to minority class labels in the training data. If your training data set
is very imbalanced, consider downsampling the majority class, upsampling the
minority class, or gathering more data.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-inference-nested-limitation"></a>Deeply nested objects affect inference performance<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>If the data that you run inference against contains documents that have a series
of combinations of dot delimited and nested fields (for example:
<code class="literal">{"a.b": "c", "a": {"b": "c"},...}</code>), the performance of the operation might be
slightly slower. Consider using as simple mapping as possible for the best
performance profile.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-feature-importance-limitation"></a>Analytics runtime performance may significantly slow down with feature importance computation<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>For complex models (such as those with many deep trees), the calculation of
feature importance takes significantly more time. Feature importance is
calculated at the end of the analysis and therefore the job may appear to be
stuck at 99% for several hours.</p>
<p>If a reduction in runtime is important to you, try strategies such as disabling
feature importance, using a smaller transform, setting
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/put-dfanalytics.html#ml-hyperparam-optimization" class="ulink" target="_top">hyperparameter</a> values, or
only selecting fields that are relevant for analysis.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-inference-multi-field"></a>Analytics training on multi-field values may affect inference<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfanalytics-limitations.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Data frame analytics jobs dynamically select the best field when multi-field
values are included. For example, if a multi-field <code class="literal">foo</code> is included for training,
the <code class="literal">foo.keyword</code> is actually used. This poses a complication for inference with
the inference processor. Documents supplied to ingest pipelines are not mapped. Consequently,
only the field <code class="literal">foo</code> is present. This means that a model trained with the field <code class="literal">foo.keyword</code>
does not take the field <code class="literal">foo</code> into account.</p>
<p>You can work around this limitation by using the <code class="literal">field_mappings</code> parameter in the inference processor.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="screen">{
  "inference": {
    "model_id": "my_model_with_multi-fields",
    "field_mappings": {
      "foo": "foo.keyword"
    },
    "inference_config": { "regression": {} }
  }
}</pre>
