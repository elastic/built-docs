<p>Inference is a machine learning feature that enables you to use supervised machine learning processes
– like <a class="xref" href="dfa-regression.html" title="Regression">Regression</a> or <a class="xref" href="dfa-classification.html" title="Classification">Classification</a> – not only as a batch
analysis but in a continuous fashion. This means that inference makes it possible
to use trained machine learning models against incoming data.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose you have an online service and you would like to predict
whether a customer is likely to churn. You have an index with historical data –
information on the customer behavior throughout the years in your business – and
a classification model that is trained on this data. The new information comes
into a destination index of a continuous transform. With inference, you can perform the
classification analysis against the new data with the same input fields that you&#8217;ve
trained the model on, and get a prediction.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the machinery behind inference.</p>
<h4><a id="ml-inference-models"></a>Trained machine learning models as functions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-inference.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>When you create a data frame analytics job that executes a supervised process, you need
to train a machine learning model on a training dataset to be able to make predictions on
data points that the model has never seen. The models that are created by
data frame analytics are stored as Elasticsearch documents in internal indices. In other words,
the characteristics of your trained models are saved and ready to be used as
functions.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use a pre-trained language identification model to
determine the language of text. Language identification supports 109 languages. For
more information and configuration details, check the <a class="xref" href="ml-lang-ident.html" title="Language identification">Language identification</a> page.</p>
<h4><a id="ml-inference-processor"></a>Inference processor<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.6/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-inference.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Inference is a processor specified in an <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/pipeline.html" class="ulink" target="_top">ingest pipeline</a>.
It uses a stored data frame analytics model to infer against the data that is being
ingested in the pipeline. The model is used on the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/ingest.html" class="ulink" target="_top">ingest node</a>. Inference pre-processes the data by using the
model and provides a prediction. After the process, the pipeline continues
executing (if there is any other processor in the pipeline), finally the new
data together with the results are indexed into the destination index.</p>
<p>Check the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/inference-processor.html" class="ulink" target="_top">inference processor</a> and
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/ml-df-analytics-apis.html" class="ulink" target="_top">the machine learning data frame analytics API documentation</a> to
learn more about the feature.</p>
