<p>Machine learning features analyze your data and generate models for its patterns of
behavior. The type of analysis that you choose depends on the questions or
problems you want to address and the type of data you have available.</p>
<h3><a id="get-started-unsupervised"></a>Unsupervised machine learning<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.x/docs/en/stack/ml/get-started/ml-getting-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>There are two types of analysis that can deduce the patterns and relationships
within your data without training or intervention: <em>anomaly detection</em> and
<em>outlier detection</em>.</p>
<p><a class="xref" href="xpack-ml.html" title="Anomaly detection">Anomaly detection</a> requires time series data. It constructs a
probability model and can run continuously to identify unusual events as they
occur. The model evolves over time; you can use its insights to forecast future
behavior.</p>
<p><a class="xref" href="dfa-outlier-detection.html" title="Outlier detection">Outlier detection</a> does not require time series data;
it identifies unusual points in a data set by analyzing how close each data
point is to others and the density of the cluster of points around it. It does
not run continuously; it generates a copy of your data set where each data point
is annotated with an outlier score. The score indicates the extent to which a data
point is an outlier compared to other data points.</p>
<h3><a id="get-started-supervised"></a>Supervised machine learning<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.x/docs/en/stack/ml/get-started/ml-getting-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>There are two types of analysis that require training data sets:
<em>classification</em> and <em>regression</em>.</p>
<p>In both cases, the result is a copy of your data set where each data point is
annotated with predictions and a trained model, which you can deploy to make
predictions for new data. For more information, refer to
<a class="xref" href="ml-supervised-workflow.html" title="Introduction to supervised learning">Introduction to supervised learning</a>.</p>
<p><a class="xref" href="dfa-classification.html" title="Classification">Classification</a> learns relationships between your
data points in order to predict discrete categorical values, such as whether a
DNS request originates from a malicious or benign domain.</p>
<p><a class="xref" href="dfa-regression.html" title="Regression">Regression</a> learns relationships between your data
points in order to predict continuous numerical values, such as the response
time for a web request.</p>

<p>Ready to take machine learning for a test drive? Follow this tutorial to:</p>

</li>
<li class="listitem">
Use the results to identify possible anomalies in the data

<p>At the end of this tutorial, you should have a good idea of what machine learning is and
will hopefully be inspired to use it to detect anomalies in your own data.</p>
<p>Need more context? Check out the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/elasticsearch-intro.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elasticsearch introduction</a> to learn the lingo and
understand the basics of how Elasticsearch works.</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Before you can play with the machine learning features, you must install Elasticsearch and Kibana.
Elasticsearch stores the data and the analysis results. Kibana provides a helpful user
interface for creating and viewing jobs.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>You can run Elasticsearch and Kibana on your own hardware, or use our
<a href="/cloud/elasticsearch-service" class="ulink" target="_top">hosted Elasticsearch Service</a> on Elastic Cloud.
The Elasticsearch Service is available on both AWS and GCP.

<li class="listitem">
Verify that your environment is set up properly to use the machine learning features. If
the Elasticsearch security features are enabled, to complete this tutorial you need a
user that has authority to manage anomaly detection jobs. See <a class="xref" href="setup.html" title="Set up machine learning features"><em>Setup and security</em></a>.
