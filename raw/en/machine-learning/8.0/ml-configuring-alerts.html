<p>Kibana alerting features include support for machine learning rules, which run scheduled
checks for anomalies in one or more anomaly detection jobs or check the
health of the job with certain conditions. If the conditions of the rule are met, an
alert is created and the associated action is triggered. For example, you can
create a rule to check an anomaly detection job every fifteen minutes for critical
anomalies and to notify you in an email. To learn more about Kibana
alerting features, refer to
<a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.0/alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-getting-started" class="ulink" target="_top">Alerting</a>.</p>
<p>The following machine learning rules are available:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">

</span>
</dt>
<dd>

<span class="term">

</div></div></div>
<p>You can create machine learning rules in the anomaly detection job wizard after you start the job,
from the job list, or under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Stack Management &gt; Alerts and Actions</strong></span>.</p>
<p>On the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Create rule</strong></span> window, give a name to the rule and optionally provide
tags. Specify the time interval for the rule to check detected anomalies or job
health changes. It is recommended to select an interval that is close to the
bucket span of the job. You can also select a notification option with the
<em>Notify</em> selector. An alert remains active as long as the configured conditions
are met during the check interval. When there is no matching condition in the
next interval, the <code class="literal">Recovered</code> action group is invoked and the status of the
alert changes to <code class="literal">OK</code>. For more details, refer to the documentation of
<a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.0/create-and-manage-rules.html#defining-rules-general-details" class="ulink" target="_top">general rule details</a>.</p>
<p>Select the rule type you want to create under the machine learning section and continue to
configure it depending on whether it is an
<a class="xref" href="ml-configuring-alerts.html#creating-anomaly-alert-rules" title="Anomaly detection alert">anomaly detection alert</a> or an

</div></div></div>
<p>Select the job that the rule applies to.</p>
<p>You must select a type of machine learning result. In particular, you can create rules based
on bucket, record, or influencer results.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-anomaly-alert-severity.jpg" alt="Selecting result type, severity, and test interval" width="500">
</div>
</div>
<p>For each rule, you can configure the <code class="literal">anomaly_score</code> that triggers the action.
The <code class="literal">anomaly_score</code> indicates the significance of a given anomaly compared to
previous anomalies. The default severity threshold is 75 which means every
anomaly with an <code class="literal">anomaly_score</code> of 75 or higher triggers the associated action.</p>
<p>You can select whether you want to include interim results. Interim results are
created by the anomaly detection job before a bucket is finalized. These results might
disappear after the bucket is fully processed. Include interim results if you
want to be notified earlier about a potential anomaly even if it might be a
false positive. If you want to get notified only about anomalies of fully
processed buckets, do not include interim results.</p>
<p>You can also configure advanced settings. <em>Lookback interval</em> sets an interval
that is used to query previous anomalies during each condition check. Its value
is derived from the bucket span of the job and the query delay of the datafeed by
default. It is not recommended to set the lookback interval lower than the
default value as it might result in missed anomalies. <em>Number of latest buckets</em>
sets how many buckets to check to obtain the highest anomaly from all the
anomalies that are found during the <em>Lookback interval</em>. An alert is created
based on the anomaly with the highest anomaly score from the most anomalous
bucket.</p>
<p>You can also test the configured conditions against your existing data and check
the sample results by providing a valid interval for your data. The generated
preview contains the number of potentially created alerts during the relative
time range you defined.</p>

<p>Select the job or group that
the rule applies to. If you assign more jobs to the group, they are
included the next time the rule conditions are checked.</p>
<p>You can also use a special character (<code class="literal">*</code>) to apply the rule to all your jobs.
Jobs created after the rule are automatically included. You can exclude jobs
that are not critically important by using the <em>Exclude</em> field.</p>
<p>Enable the health check types that you want to apply. All checks are enabled by
default. At least one check needs to be enabled to create the rule. The
following health checks are available:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>Datafeed is not started</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Notifies if the corresponding datafeed of the job is not started but the job is
in an opened state. The notification message recommends the necessary
actions to solve the error.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>Model memory limit reached</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Notifies if the model memory status of the job reaches the soft or hard model
memory limit. Optimize your job by following
<a class="xref" href="anomaly-detection-scale.html#detector-configuration" title="4. Understand how detector configuration can impact model memory">these guidelines</a> or consider

</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>Data delay has occurred</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Notifies when the job missed some data. You can define the threshold for the
amount of missing documents you get alerted on by setting
<em>Number of documents</em>. You can control the lookback interval for checking
delayed data with <em>Time interval</em>. Refer to the
<a class="xref" href="ml-delayed-data-detection.html" title="Handling delayed data">Handling delayed data</a> page to see what to do about delayed data.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>Errors in job messages</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Notifies when the job messages contain error messages. Review the
notification; it contains the error messages, the corresponding job IDs and
recommendations on how to fix the issue. This check looks for job errors
that occur after the rule is created; it does not look at historic behavior.

<p>Connect your rule to actions that use supported built-in integrations by
selecting a connector type. Connectors are Kibana services or third-party

<p>For example, you can choose <em>Slack</em> as a connector type and configure it to send
a message to a channel you selected. You can also create an index connector that
writes the JSON object you configure to a specific index. It&#8217;s also possible to
customize the notification messages. A list of variables is available to include
in the message, like job ID, anomaly score, time, top influencers, datafeed ID,
memory status and so on based on the selected rule type. Refer to
<a class="xref" href="ml-configuring-alerts.html#action-variables" title="Action variables">Action variables</a> to see the full list of available variables by rule type.</p>

<p>After you save the configurations, the rule appears in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alerts and Actions</strong></span> list
where you can check its status and see the overview of its configuration
information.</p>
<p>The name of an alert is always the same as the job ID of the associated
anomaly detection job that triggered it. You can mute the notifications for a particular
anomaly detection job on the page of the rule that lists the individual alerts. You can
open it via <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alerts and Actions</strong></span> by selecting the rule name.</p>
