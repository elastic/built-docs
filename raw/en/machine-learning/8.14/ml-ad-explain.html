<p>Every anomaly has an anomaly score assigned to it. That score indicates how
anomalous the data point is, which makes it possible to define its severity
compared to other anomalies. This page gives you a high-level explanation of the
critical factors considered for calculating anomaly scores, how the scores
are calculated, and how renormalization works.</p>
<h4><a id="score-impact-factors"></a>Anomaly score impact factors<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.14/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-ad-explain.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Anomaly detection jobs split the time series data into time buckets. The data within
a bucket is aggregated using functions. Anomaly detection is happening on the
bucket values. Three factors can affect the initial anomaly score of a record:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
single bucket impact,
</li>
<li class="listitem">
multi-bucket impact,
</li>
<li class="listitem">
anomaly characteristics impact.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h5><a id="single-bucket-impact"></a>Single bucket impact<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.14/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-ad-explain.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>The probability of the actual value in the bucket is calculated first. This
probability depends on how many similar values were seen in the past. It often
relates to the difference between actual and typical values. The typical value
is the median value of the probability distribution for the bucket. This
probability leads to the single bucket impact. It usually dominates the initial
anomaly score of a short spike or dip.</p>
<h5><a id="multi-bucket-impact"></a>Multi-bucket impact<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.14/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-ad-explain.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>The probabilities of the values in the current bucket and the preceding 11
buckets contribute to the multi-bucket impact. The accumulated differences
between the actual and typical values result in the multi-bucket impact on the
initial anomaly score of the current bucket. High multi-bucket impact indicates
unusual behavior in the interval preceding the current bucket, even if the value
of this bucket may be within the 95% confidence interval.</p>
<p>Different signs mark the anomalies with high multi-bucket impact to highlight
the distinction. A cross sign "+" represents these anomalies in Kibana, instead
of a circle.</p>
<h5><a id="anomaly-characteristics-impact"></a>Anomaly characteristics impact<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.14/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-ad-explain.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>The impact of the anomaly characteristics considers the different features of
the anomaly, such as its length and size. The total duration of the anomaly is
considered, and not a fixed interval as in the case of the multi-bucket impact
calculation. The length might be only one bucket or thirty (or more) buckets.
Comparing the length and size of the anomaly to the historical averages makes it
possible to adapt to your domain and the patterns in data. The default behavior
of the algorithm is to score longer anomalies higher than short-lived spikes. In
practice, short anomalies often turn out to be errors in data, while long
anomalies are something you might need to react to.</p>
<p>Combining multi-bucket impact and anomaly characteristics impact leads to more
reliable detection of abnormal behavior over various domains.</p>
<h4><a id="record-score-reduction"></a>Record score reduction (renormalization)<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.14/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-ad-explain.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Anomaly scores are in the range of 0 and 100. The values close to 100 signify
the biggest anomalies the job has seen to date. For this reason, when an anomaly
bigger than any other before is detected, the scores of previous anomalies need
to be reduced.</p>
<p>The process when the anomaly detection algorithm adjusts the anomaly scores of
past records when new data comes in is called <em>renormalization</em>. The
<code class="literal">renormalization_window_days</code> configuration parameter specifies the time
interval for this adjustment. The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span> in Kibana highlights
the renormalization change.</p>

<h4><a id="other-factors"></a>Other factors for score reduction<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.14/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-ad-explain.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Two more factors may lead to a reduction of the initial score: a high variance
interval and an incomplete bucket.</p>
<p>Anomaly detection is less reliable if the current bucket is part of a
seasonal pattern with high variability in its data. For example, you may have
server maintenance jobs running every night at midnight. These jobs can lead to
high variability in the latency of request processing. The job is also more
reliable if the current bucket has received a similar number of observations as
historically expected.</p>
<p>Real-world anomalies often show the impacts of several factors. The
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly explanation</strong></span> section in the Single Metric Viewer can help you
interpret an anomaly in its context.</p>
