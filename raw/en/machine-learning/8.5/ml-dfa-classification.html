<p>Classification is a machine learning process that predicts the class or category of a
data point in a data set. For a simple example, consider how the shapes in the
following graph can be differentiated and classified as "circles" and
"triangles":</p>
<div class="imageblock text-center">

</div>
<p>In reality, classification problems are more complex, such as classifying
malicious and benign domains to detect DGA activities for security reasons or
predicting customer churn based on customer calling data. Classification
is for predicting discrete, categorical values.</p>
<p>When you create a classification job, you must specify which field contains
the classes that you want to predict. This field is known as the <em>dependent variable</em>. It
can contain maximum 100 classes. By default, all other
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.5/put-dfanalytics.html#dfa-supported-fields" class="ulink" target="_top">supported fields</a> are included
in the analysis and are known as <em>feature variables</em>. You can optionally include or
exclude fields. For more information about field selection, refer to the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.5/explain-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">explain data frame analytics API</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-classification-algorithm"></a>Classification algorithms<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Classification analysis uses an ensemble algorithm that is a type of boosting called
boosted tree regression model which combines multiple weak models into a
composite one. It uses decision trees to learn to predict the probability that a
data point belongs to a certain class. A sequence of decision trees are trained
and every decision tree learns from the mistakes of the previous one. Every tree
is an iteration of the last one, hence it improves the decision made by the
previous tree.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-classification-problem"></a>1. Define the problem<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Classification can be useful in cases where discrete, categorical values
needs to be predicted. If your use case requires predicting such values, then
classification might be the suitable choice for you.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-classification-environment"></a>2. Set up the environment<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Before you can use the Elastic Stack machine learning features, there are some configuration
requirements (such as security privileges) that must be addressed. Refer to
<a class="xref" href="setup.html" title="Set up machine learning features"><em>Setup and security</em></a>.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-classification-prepare-data"></a>3. Prepare and transform data<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Classification is a supervised machine learning method, which means you need to supply
a labeled training data set. This data set must have values for the
feature variables and the dependent variable which are used to train the model. The training
process uses this information to learn the relationships between the classes
and the feature variables. This labeled data set also plays a critical role in
model evaluation.</p>
<p>If possible, prepare your input data such that it has less classes. A
classification analysis with many classes takes more time to run than a binary
classification job. The relationship between the number of classes and the
runtime is roughly linear.</p>
<p>You might also need to <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.5/transforms.html" class="ulink" target="_top">transform</a> your data to create a
data frame which can be used as the source for classification.</p>
<p>To learn more about how to prepare your data, refer to
<a class="xref" href="ml-dfa-overview.html#prepare-transform-data" title="Prepare and transform data">the relevant section</a> of the supervised learning
overview.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-classification-create-job"></a>4. Create a job<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Data frame analytics jobs contain the configuration information and metadata
necessary to perform an analytics task. You can create data frame analytics jobs via
Kibana or using the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.5/put-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">create data frame analytics jobs API</a>.</p>
<p>Select classification as the analytics type, then select the field that you
want to predict (the dependent variable). You can also include and exclude fields.</p>
<p>To improve performance, consider using a small <code class="literal">training_percent</code> value to train
the model more quickly. It is a good strategy to make progress iteratively: run
the analysis with a small training percentage, then evaluate the performance.
Based on the results, you can decide if it is necessary to increase the
<code class="literal">training_percent</code> value.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-classification-start"></a>5. Start the job<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You can start the job via Kibana or using the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.5/start-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">start data frame analytics jobs</a> API. A classification

<h3><a id="ml-dfanalytics-classification-evaluation"></a>6. Evaluate and interpret the result<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Using the data frame analytics features to gain insights from a data set is an
iterative process. After you defined the problem you want to solve, and chose
the analytics type that can help you to do so, you need to produce a
high-quality data set and create the appropriate data frame analytics job. You might
need to experiment with different configurations, parameters, and ways to
transform data before you arrive at a result that satisfies your use case. A
valuable companion to this process is the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.5/evaluate-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">evaluate data frame analytics API</a>, which enables you to evaluate
the data frame analytics performance. It helps you understand error distributions and
identifies the points where the data frame analytics model performs well or less
trustworthily.</p>
<p>To evaluate the analysis with this API, you need to annotate your index that
contains the results of the analysis with a field that marks each document with
the ground truth. The evaluate data frame analytics API evaluates the performance of the
data frame analytics against this manually provided ground truth.</p>
<p>You can measure how well the model has performed on your training data set by
using the <code class="literal">classification</code> evaluation type of the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.5/evaluate-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">evaluate data frame analytics API</a> or by viewing the
job results in Kibana. The classification evaluation offers the following
metrics to evaluate the model performance:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Multiclass confusion matrix
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic (AUC ROC)
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The following metrics helps you interpret the analysis results:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
feature importance
</li>

<h4><a id="ml-dfanalytics-mccm"></a>Multiclass confusion matrix<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The multiclass confusion matrix provides a summary of the performance of the
classification analysis. It contains the number of occurrences where the analysis
classified data points correctly with their actual class as well as the number
of occurrences where it misclassified them.</p>
<p>This is an example of a confusion matrix for a binary problem:</p>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/confusion-matrix-binary.jpg" alt="Confusion matrix of a binary problem" width="75%">
</div>
</div>
<p>It is a two by two matrix because there are only two classes (<code class="literal">true</code> and
<code class="literal">false</code>). It shows the proportion of data points that is correctly identified as
members of a each class and the proportion that is misidentified.</p>
<p>As the number of classes increases, the confusion matrix becomes more complex:</p>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/confusion-matrix-multiclass.jpg" alt="Confusion matrix of a multiclass problem" width="100%">
</div>
</div>
<p>This matrix contains the actual labels on the left side while the predicted
labels are on the top. The proportion of correct and incorrect predictions is
broken down for each class. This enables you to examine how the classification analysis
confused the different classes while it made its predictions.</p>
<h4><a id="ml-dfanalytics-class-aucroc"></a>Area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic (AUC ROC)<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a plot that represents the
performance of the classification process at different predicted probability
thresholds. It compares the true positive rate for a specific class against the
rate of all the other classes combined ("one versus all" strategy) at the
different threshold levels to create the curve.</p>
<p>For example, there are three classes: <code class="literal">A</code>, <code class="literal">B</code>, and <code class="literal">C</code>, and AUC ROC is
calculated for <code class="literal">A</code>. In this case, the number of correctly classified <code class="literal">A</code>s
(true positives) are compared to the number of <code class="literal">B</code>s and <code class="literal">C</code>s that are
misclassified as <code class="literal">A</code>s (false positives).</p>
<p>From this plot, you can compute the area under the curve (AUC) value, which is a
number between 0 and 1. The higher the AUC, the better the model is at
predicting <code class="literal">A</code>s as <code class="literal">A</code>s, in this case.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>To use this evaluation method, you must set <code class="literal">num_top_classes</code> to <code class="literal">-1</code>
or a value greater than or equal to the total number of classes when you create
the data frame analytics job.</p>

<h4><a id="dfa-classification-feature-importance"></a>Feature importance<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Feature importance provides further information about the results of an analysis and
helps to interpret the results in a more subtle way. If you want to learn more
about feature importance, refer to <a class="xref" href="ml-feature-importance.html" title="Feature importance">Feature importance</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="dfa-classification-class-probability"></a><code class="literal">class_probability</code><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The <code class="literal">class_probability</code> is a value between 0 and 1, which indicates how likely
it is that a given data point belongs to a certain class. The higher the number,
the higher the probability that the data point belongs to the named class. This
information is stored in the <code class="literal">top_classes</code> array for each document in the
destination index.</p>
<h4><a id="dfa-classification-class-score"></a><code class="literal">class_score</code><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The <code class="literal">class_score</code> is a function of the <code class="literal">class_probability</code> and has a value that
is greater than or equal to zero. It takes into consideration your objective (as
defined in the <code class="literal">class_assignment_objective</code> job configuration option):
<em>accuracy</em> or <em>recall</em>.</p>
<p>If your objective is to maximize accuracy, the scores are weighted to maximize
the proportion of correct predictions in the training data set.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/confusion-matrix-binary-accuracy.jpg" alt="A confusion matrix with the correct predictions highlighted" width="75%">
</div>
</div>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If there is an imbalanced class distribution in your training data,
focusing on accuracy can decrease your model&#8217;s sensitivity to incorrect
predictions in the under-represented classes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>By default, classification analysis jobs accept a slight degradation of the overall
accuracy in return for greater sensitivity to classes that are predicted
incorrectly. That is to say, their objective is to maximize the minimum recall.
For example, in the context of a multi-class confusion matrix, the predictions
of interest are in each row:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/confusion-matrix-multiclass-recall.jpg" alt="A confusion matrix with a row highlighted">
</div>
</div>
<p>For each class, the recall is calculated as the number of correct predictions
divided by the sum of all the other predicted labels in that row. This value is
represented as a percentage in each cell of the confusion matrix. The class
scores are then weighted to favor predictions that result in the highest recall
values across the training data. This objective typically performs better than
accuracy when you have highly imbalanced data.</p>

<p>Inference is a machine learning feature that enables you to use supervised machine learning processes
– like regression or classification – not only as a batch analysis but in a
continuous fashion. This means that inference makes it possible to use
<a class="xref" href="ml-trained-models.html" title="Trained models">trained machine learning models</a> against incoming data.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose you have an online service and you would like to predict
whether a customer is likely to churn. You have an index with historical data –
information on the customer behavior throughout the years in your business – and
a classification model that is trained on this data. The new information comes
into a destination index of a continuous transform. With inference, you can perform the
classification analysis against the new data with the same input fields that you&#8217;ve
trained the model on, and get a prediction.</p>
<h5><a id="ml-inference-processor-class"></a>Inference processor<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>Inference can be used as a processor specified in an
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.5/ingest.html" class="ulink" target="_top">ingest pipeline</a>. It uses a trained model to infer against
the data that is being ingested in the pipeline. The model is used on the ingest
node. Inference pre-processes the data by using the model and provides a
prediction. After the process, the pipeline continues executing (if there is any
other processor in the pipeline), finally the new data together with the results
are indexed into the destination index.</p>
<p>Check the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.5/inference-processor.html" class="ulink" target="_top">inference processor</a> and

<p>Inference can also be used as a pipeline aggregation. You can reference a
trained model in the aggregation to infer on the result field of the parent
bucket aggregation. The inference aggregation uses the model on the results to
provide a prediction. This aggregation enables you to run classification or
regression analysis at search time. If you want to perform the analysis on a small set
of data, this aggregation enables you to generate predictions without the need
to set up a processor in the ingest pipeline.</p>

<p>Each document in the sample flight data set contains details for a single
flight, so the data is ready for analysis; it is already in a two-dimensional

<p>In order to be analyzed, a document must contain at least one field with a
supported data type (<code class="literal">numeric</code>, <code class="literal">boolean</code>, <code class="literal">text</code>, <code class="literal">keyword</code> or <code class="literal">ip</code>) and must
not contain arrays with more than one item. If your source data consists of some
documents that contain the dependent variable and some that do not, the model is

<p>If you want these charts to represent data from a larger sample size or from a

<p>Now you have a new index that contains a copy of your source data with
predictions for your dependent variable.</p>
<p>When you view the classification results in Kibana, it shows the contents of
the destination index in a tabular format. It also provides information about
the analysis details, model evaluation metrics, total feature importance values, and a
scatterplot matrix.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/flights-classification-results.jpg" alt="Destination index table for a classification job in Kibana">
</div>
</div>
<p>The table shows a column for the dependent variable (<code class="literal">FlightDelay</code>), which contains the
ground truth values that you are trying to predict. It also shows a column for
the predicted values (<code class="literal">ml.FlightDelay_prediction</code>), which were generated by the
classification analysis. The <code class="literal">ml.is_training</code> column indicates whether the document was
used in the training or testing data set. You can use the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Training</strong></span> and
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Testing</strong></span> filter options to refine the contents of the results table. You can
also enable histogram charts to get a better understanding of the distribution
of values.</p>
<p>If you want to understand how certain the model is about each prediction, you
can examine its probability and score (<code class="literal">ml.prediction_probability</code> and
<code class="literal">ml.prediction_score</code>). The higher these values are, the more confident the
model is that the data point belongs to the named class. If you examine the
destination index more closely in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Discover</strong></span> app in Kibana or use the
standard Elasticsearch search command, you can see that the analysis predicts the
probability of all possible classes for the dependent variable. The <code class="literal">top_classes</code> object
contains the predicted classes with the highest scores.</p>

<p>The class with the highest score is the prediction. In this example, <code class="literal">false</code> has

<p>If you chose to calculate feature importance, the destination index also contains
<code class="literal">ml.feature_importance</code> objects. Every field that is included in the
analysis (known as a <em>feature</em> of the data point) is assigned a feature importance
value. It has both a magnitude and a direction (positive or negative), which
indicates how each field affects a particular prediction. Only the most
significant values (in this case, the top 10) are stored in the index. However,
the trained model metadata also contains the average magnitude of the feature importance
values for each field across all the training data. You can view this
summarized information in Kibana:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/flights-classification-total-importance.jpg" alt="Total feature importance values in Kibana">
</div>
</div>
<p>You can also see the feature importance values for each individual prediction in the
form of a decision plot:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/flights-classification-importance.png" alt="A decision plot for feature importance values in Kibana">
</div>
</div>
<p>In Kibana, the decision path shows the relative impact of each feature on the
probability of the prediction. The features with the most significant positive
or negative impact appear at the top of the decision plot. Thus in this example,
the features related to flight time and distance had the most significant
influence on the probability value for this prediction. This type of information
can help you to understand how models arrive at their predictions. It can also
indicate which aspects of your data set are most influential or least useful
when you are training and tuning your model.</p>
<p>If you do not use Kibana, you can see the summarized feature importance values by using
the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.5/get-inference.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get trained model API</a> and the individual values by

<p>Lastly, Kibana provides a scatterplot matrix in the results. It has the same
functionality as the matrix that you saw in the job wizard. Its purpose is to
help you visualize and explore the relationships between the numeric fields and
the dependent variable.</p>
<h4><a id="flightdata-classification-evaluate"></a>Evaluating classification results<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.5/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Though you can look at individual results and compare the predicted value
(<code class="literal">ml.FlightDelay_prediction</code>) to the actual value (<code class="literal">FlightDelay</code>), you
typically need to evaluate the success of your classification model as a
whole.</p>
<p>Kibana provides a <em>normalized confusion matrix</em> that contains the percentage of
occurrences where the analysis classified data points correctly with their
actual class and the percentage of occurrences where it misclassified them.</p>

<div class="note admon">

<div class="admon_content">
<p>As the sample data may change when it is loaded into Kibana, the results of
the analysis can vary even if you use the same configuration as the example.
Therefore, use this information as a guideline for interpreting your own
results.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you want to see the exact number of occurrences, select a quadrant in the
matrix. You can also use the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Training</strong></span> and <span class="strong strong"><strong>Testing</strong></span> filter options to refine
the contents of the matrix. Thus you can see how well the model performs on
previously unseen data. You can check how many documents are <code class="literal">true</code> in the
testing data, how many of them are identified correctly (<em>true positives</em>) and
how many of them are identified incorrectly as <code class="literal">false</code> (<em>false negatives</em>).</p>
<p>Likewise if you select other quadrants in the matrix, it shows the number of
documents that have the <code class="literal">false</code> class as their actual value in the testing data. The matrix shows the number of documents that are correctly identified as
<code class="literal">false</code> (<em>true negatives</em>) and the number of documents that are incorrectly
predicted as <code class="literal">true</code> (<em>false positives</em>). When you perform classification analysis on
your own data, it might take multiple iterations before you are satisfied with
the results and ready to deploy the model.</p>
<p>Kibana also provides the <em>receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve</em> as part
of the model evaluation. The plot compares the true positive rate (y-axis) to
the false positive rate (x-axis) for each class; in this example, <code class="literal">true</code> and
<code class="literal">false</code>. From this plot, the area under the curve (AUC) value is computed. It
is a number between 0 and 1. The higher the AUC, the better the model is at
predicting the classes correctly.</p>
