<p>After the anomaly detection job has processed some data, you can view the results in
Kibana.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Depending on the capacity of your machine, you might need to wait a few
seconds for the machine learning analysis to generate initial results.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are two tools for examining the results from anomaly detection jobs in Kibana: the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span> and the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span>.</p>
<h4><a id="ml-ad-bucket-results"></a>Bucket results<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.15/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-ad-view-results.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>When you view your machine learning results, each bucket has an anomaly score. This score is
a statistically aggregated and normalized view of the combined anomalousness of
all the record results in the bucket.</p>
<p>The machine learning analytics enhance the anomaly score for each bucket by considering
contiguous buckets. This extra <em>multi-bucket analysis</em> effectively uses a
sliding window to evaluate the events in each bucket relative to the larger
context of recent events. When you review your machine learning results, there is a
<code class="literal">multi_bucket_impact</code> property that indicates how strongly the final anomaly
score is influenced by multi-bucket analysis. In Kibana, anomalies with medium or
high multi-bucket impact are depicted in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span> and the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span> with a cross symbol instead of a dot. For example:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/multibucketanalysis.jpg" alt="Examples of anomalies with multi-bucket impact in Kibana">
</div>
</div>
<p>In this example, you can see that some of the anomalies fall within the shaded
blue area, which represents the bounds for the expected values. The bounds are
calculated per bucket, but multi-bucket analysis is not limited by that scope.</p>
<p>Both the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span> and the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span> contain an
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomalies</strong></span> table that shows key details about each anomaly such as time,
typical and actual values, and probability. The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly explanation</strong></span> section
helps you to interpret a given anomaly by providing further insights about its
type, impact, and score.</p>
<p>If you have <a class="xref" href="ml-configuring-alerts.html#creating-anomaly-alert-rules" title="Anomaly detection alert rules">Anomaly detection alert rules</a> applied to an anomaly detection job and an
alert has occured for the rule, you can view how the alert correlates with the
anomaly detection results in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span> by using the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly timeline</strong></span> swimlane and the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alerts</strong></span> panel. The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alerts</strong></span> panel
contains a line chart with the alerts count over time. The cursor on the line
chart is in sync with the anomaly swimlane making it easier to review anomalous
buckets with the spike produced by the alerts. The panel also contains
aggregated information for each alert rule associated with the job selection
such as the total number of active, recovered, and untracked alerts for the
selected job and time range. An alert context menu is displayed when an anomaly
swimlane cell is selected with alerts in the chosen time range. The context menu
contains the alert counters for the selected time buckets.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>If you have more than one anomaly detection job, you can also obtain <em>overall bucket</em>
results, which combine and correlate anomalies from multiple jobs into an
overall score. When you view the results for job groups in Kibana, it provides
the overall bucket scores. For more information, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/ml-get-overall-buckets.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Get overall buckets API</a>.</p>
<p>Bucket results provide the top level, overall view of the anomaly detection job and are
ideal for alerts. For example, the bucket results might indicate that at 16:05
the system was unusual. This information is a summary of all the anomalies,
pinpointing when they occurred. When you identify an anomalous bucket, you can
investigate further by examining the pertinent records.</p>
<h4><a id="ml-ad-influencer-results"></a>Influencer results<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.15/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/ml-ad-view-results.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The influencer results show which entities were anomalous and when. One
influencer result is written per bucket for each influencer that affects the
anomalousness of the bucket. The machine learning analytics determine the impact of an
influencer by performing a series of experiments that remove all data points
with a specific influencer value and check whether the bucket is still
anomalous. That means that only influencers with statistically significant
impact on the anomaly are reported in the results. For jobs with more than one
detector, influencer scores provide a powerful view of the most anomalous
entities.</p>
<p>For example, the <code class="literal">high_sum_total_sales</code> anomaly detection job for the eCommerce orders
sample data uses <code class="literal">customer_full_name.keyword</code> and <code class="literal">category.keyword</code> as
influencers. You can examine the influencer results with the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/ml-get-influencer.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get influencers API</a>. Alternatively, you can use
the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span> in Kibana:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/influencers.jpg" alt="Influencers in the Kibana Anomaly Explorer">
</div>
</div>
<p>On the left is a list of the top influencers for all of the detected anomalies
in that same time period. The list includes maximum anomaly scores, which in
this case are aggregated for each influencer, for each bucket, across all
detectors. There is also a total sum of the anomaly scores for each influencer.
You can use this list to help you narrow down the contributing factors and focus
on the most anomalous entities.</p>
<p>You can also explore swim lanes that correspond to the values of an influencer.
In this example, the swim lanes correspond to the values for the
<code class="literal">customer_full_name.keyword</code>. By default, the swim lanes are sorted according to
which entity has the maximum anomaly score values. You can click on the sections
in the swim lane to see details about the anomalies that occurred in that time
interval.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The anomaly scores that you see in each section of the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span>
might differ slightly. This disparity occurs because for each anomaly detection job,
there are bucket results, influencer results, and record results. Anomaly scores
are generated for each type of result. The anomaly timeline in Kibana uses the
bucket-level anomaly scores. If you view swim lanes by influencer, it uses the
influencer-level anomaly scores, as does the list of top influencers. The list
of anomalies uses the record-level anomaly scores.</p>
