<p>There are many advanced configuration options for anomaly detection jobs, some of them
affect the performance or resource usage significantly. This guide contains a
list of considerations to help you plan for using anomaly detection at scale.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The following recommendations are not sequential – the numbers just help to
navigate between the list items; you can take action on one or more of them in
any order. You can implement some of these changes on existing jobs; others
require you to clone an existing job or create a new one.</p>
<h4><a id="node-sizing"></a>1. Consider autoscaling, node sizing, and configuration<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>An anomaly detection job runs on a single node and requires sufficient resources to hold
its model in memory. When a job is opened, it will be placed on the node with
the most available memory at that time.</p>
<p>The memory available to the machine learning native processes can roughly be thought of as
total machine RAM minus that which is required for the operating system, Elasticsearch
and any other software that is running on the same machine.</p>
<p>The available memory for machine learning on a node must be sufficient to accommodate the
size of the largest model. The total available memory across all machine learning nodes must
be sufficient to accommodate the memory requirement for all simultaneously open
jobs.</p>
<p>In Elastic Cloud, dedicated machine learning nodes are provisioned with most of the RAM
automatically being available to the machine learning native processes. If deploying
self-managed, then we recommend deploying dedicated machine learning nodes and increasing
the value of <code class="literal">xpack.ml.max_machine_memory_percent</code> from the default 30%. The
default of 30% has to be set low in case other software is running on the same
machine and to leave memory free for an OS file system cache on machine learning nodes that
are also data nodes. If you use dedicated machine learning nodes as recommended and do not
run any other software on them then it would be reasonable to run with a 2GB JVM
heap and set <code class="literal">xpack.ml.max_machine_memory_percent</code> to 90% on machines with at
least 24GB of RAM. This maximizes the number of machine learning jobs that can be run.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of nodes will allow distribution of job processing as well
as fault tolerance. If running many jobs, even small memory ones, then consider
increasing the number of nodes in your environment.</p>
<p>In Elastic Cloud, you can enable <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/xpack-autoscaling.html" class="ulink" target="_top">autoscaling</a> so that
the machine learning nodes in your cluster scale up or down based on current machine learning
memory and CPU requirements. The Elastic Cloud infrastructure allows you to create
machine learning jobs up to the size that fits on the maximum node size that the
cluster can scale to (usually somewhere between 58GB and 64GB) rather than what
would fit in the current cluster. If you attempt to use autoscaling outside of
Elastic Cloud, then set <code class="literal">xpack.ml.max_ml_node_size</code> to define the maximum possible
size of a machine learning node. Creating machine learning jobs with model memory limits larger than the
maximum node size can support is not allowed, as autoscaling cannot add a node
big enough to run the job. On a self-managed deployment, you can set
<code class="literal">xpack.ml.max_model_memory_limit</code> according to the available resources of the
machine learning node. This prevents you from you creating jobs with model memory limits too
high to open in your cluster.</p>
<h4><a id="dedicated-results-index"></a>2. Use dedicated results indices<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>For large jobs, use a dedicated results index. This ensures that results from a
single large job do not dominate the shared results index. It also ensures that
the job and results (if <code class="literal">results_retention_days</code> is set) can be deleted more
efficiently and improves renormalization performance. By default, anomaly detection job
results are stored in a shared index. To change to use a dedicated result index,
you need to clone or create a new job.</p>
<h4><a id="model-plot"></a>3. Disable model plot<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>By default, model plot is enabled when you create jobs in Kibana. If you have a
large job, however, consider disabling it. You can disable model plot for
existing jobs by using the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-update-job.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Update anomaly detection jobs API</a>.</p>
<p>Model plot calculates and stores the model bounds for each analyzed entity,
including both anomalous and non-anomalous entities. These bounds are used to
display the shaded area in the Single Metric Viewer charts. Model plot creates
one result document per bucket per split field value. If you have high
cardinality fields and/or a short bucket span, disabling model plot reduces
processing workload and results stored.</p>
<h4><a id="detector-configuration"></a>4. Understand how detector configuration can impact model memory<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The following factors are most significant in increasing the memory required for
a job:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
High cardinality of the <code class="literal">by</code> or <code class="literal">partition</code> fields
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Multiple detectors
</li>
<li class="listitem">
A high distinct count of influencers within a bucket
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Optimize your anomaly detection job by choosing only relevant influencer fields and
detectors.</p>
<p>If you have high cardinality <code class="literal">by</code> or <code class="literal">partition</code> fields, ensure you have
sufficient memory resources available for the job. Alternatively, consider if
the job can be split into smaller jobs by using a datafeed query. For very high
cardinality, using a population analysis may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>To change partitioning fields, influencers and/or detectors, you need to clone
or create a new job.</p>
<h4><a id="optimize-bucket-span"></a>5. Optimize the bucket span<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Short bucket spans and high cardinality detectors are resource intensive and
require more system resources.</p>
<p>Bucket span is typically between 15m and 1h. The recommended value always
depends on the data, the use case, and the latency required for alerting. A job
with a longer bucket span uses less resources because fewer buckets require
processing and fewer results are written. Bucket spans that are sensible
dividers of an hour or day work best as most periodic patterns have a daily
cycle.</p>
<p>If your use case is suitable, consider increasing the bucket span to reduce
processing workload. To change the bucket span, you need to clone or create a
new job.</p>
<h4><a id="set-scroll-size"></a>6. Set the <code class="literal">scroll_size</code> of the datafeed<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>This consideration only applies to datafeeds that <span class="strong strong"><strong>do not</strong></span> use aggregations. The
<code class="literal">scroll_size</code> parameter of a datafeed specifies the number of hits to return from
Elasticsearch searches. The higher the <code class="literal">scroll_size</code> the more results are returned by a
single search. When your anomaly detection job has a high throughput, increasing
<code class="literal">scroll_size</code> may decrease the time the job needs to analyze incoming data,
however may also increase the pressure on your cluster. You cannot increase
<code class="literal">scroll_size</code> to more than the value of <code class="literal">index.max_result_window</code> which is
10,000 by default. If you update the settings of a datafeed, you must stop and
start the datafeed for the change to be applied.</p>
<h4><a id="set-model-memory-limit"></a>7. Set the model memory limit<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The <code class="literal">model_memory_limit</code> job configuration option sets the approximate maximum
amount of memory resources required for analytical processing. When you create
an anomaly detection job in Kibana, it provides an estimate for this limit. The estimate
is based on the analysis configuration details for the job and cardinality
estimates, which are derived by running aggregations on the source indices as
they exist at that specific point in time.</p>
<p>If you change the resources available on your machine learning nodes or make significant
changes to the characteristics or cardinality of your data, the model memory
requirements might also change. You can update the model memory limit for a job
while it is closed. If you want to decrease the limit below the current model
memory usage, however, you must clone and re-run the job.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>You can view the current model size statistics with the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-get-job-stats.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get anomaly detection job stats</a> and
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-get-snapshot.html" class="ulink" target="_top">get model snapshots</a> APIs. You can also obtain a
model memory limit estimate at any time by running the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-estimate-model-memory.html" class="ulink" target="_top">estimate anomaly detection jobs model memory API</a>.
However, you must provide your own cardinality estimates.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As a job approaches its model memory limit, the memory status is <code class="literal">soft_limit</code>
and older models are more aggressively pruned to free up space. If you have
categorization jobs, no further examples are stored. When a job exceeds its
limit, the memory status is <code class="literal">hard_limit</code> and the job no longer models new
entities. It is therefore important to have appropriate memory model limits for
each job. If you reach the hard limit and are concerned about the missing data,
ensure that you have adequate resources then clone and re-run the job with a
larger model memory limit.</p>
<h4><a id="pre-aggregate-data"></a>8. Pre-aggregate your data<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>You can speed up the analysis by summarizing your data with aggregations.</p>
<p>Anomaly detection jobs use summary statistics that are calculated for each bucket.
The statistics can be calculated in the job itself or via aggregations. It is
more efficient to use an aggregation when it’s possible, as in this case, the
data node does the heavy-lifting instead of the machine learning node.</p>
<p>You may want to use <code class="literal">chunking_config</code> to tune your search speed when your
datafeeds use aggregations. In these cases, set <code class="literal">chunking_config.mode</code> to <code class="literal">manual</code>
and experiment with the <code class="literal">time_span</code> value. Increasing it may speed up search.
However, the higher the chunking <code class="literal">time_span</code>, the higher number of buckets are
included in the search response. Thus, if you hit the <code class="literal">search.max_buckets</code>
limit, decrease <code class="literal">time_span</code> to reduce the number of buckets per response.</p>
<p>In certain cases, you cannot do aggregations to increase performance. For
example, categorization jobs use the full log message to detect anomalies, so
this data cannot be aggregated. If you have many influencer fields, it may not
be beneficial to use an aggregation either. This is because only a few documents
in each bucket may have the combination of all the different influencer fields.</p>
<p>Please consult <a class="xref" href="ml-configuring-aggregation.html" title="Aggregating data for faster performance">Aggregating data for faster performance</a> to learn more.</p>
<h4><a id="results-retention"></a>9. Optimize the results retention<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Set a results retention window to reduce the amount of results stored.</p>
<p>Anomaly detection results are retained indefinitely by default. Results build
up over time, and your result index may be quite large. A large results index is
slow to query and takes up significant space on your cluster. Consider how long
you wish to retain the results and set <code class="literal">results_retention_days</code> accordingly –
for example, to 30 or 60 days – to avoid unnecessarily large result indices.
Deleting old results does not affect the model behavior. You can change this
setting for existing jobs.</p>
<h4><a id="renormalization-window"></a>10. Optimize the renormalization window<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Reduce the renormalization window to reduce processing workload.</p>
<p>When a new anomaly has a much higher score than any anomaly in the past, the
anomaly scores are adjusted on a range from 0 to 100 based on the new data. This
is called renormalization. It can mean rewriting a large number of documents in
the results index. Renormalization happens for results from the last 30 days or
100 bucket spans (depending on which is the longer) by default. When you are
working at scale, set <code class="literal">renormalization_window_days</code> to a lower value, so the
workload is reduced. You can change this setting for existing jobs and changes
will take effect after the job has been reopened.</p>
<h4><a id="model-snapshot-retention"></a>11. Optimize the model snapshot retention<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Model snapshots are taken periodically, to ensure resilience in the event of a
system failure and to allow you to manually revert to a specific point in time.
These are stored in a compressed format in an internal index and kept according
to the configured retention policy. Load is placed on the cluster when indexing
a model snapshot and index size is increased as multiple snapshots are retained.</p>
<p>When working with large model sizes, consider how frequently you want to create
model snapshots using <code class="literal">background_persist_interval</code>. The default is every 3 to 4
hours. Increasing this interval reduces the periodic indexing load on your
cluster, but in the event of a system failure, you may be reverting to an older
version of the model.</p>
<p>Also consider how long you wish to retain snapshots using
<code class="literal">model_snapshot_retention_days</code> and <code class="literal">daily_model_snapshot_retention_after_days</code>.
Retaining fewer snapshots substantially reduces index storage requirements for
model state, but also reduces the granularity of model snapshots from which you
can revert.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to <a class="xref" href="ml-model-snapshots.html" title="Model snapshots">Model snapshots</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="search-queries"></a>12. Optimize your search queries<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>If you are operating on a big scale, make sure that your datafeed query is as
efficient as possible. There are different ways to write Elasticsearch queries and some
of them are more efficient than others. Please consult
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/tune-for-search-speed.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Tune for search speed</a> to learn more about Elasticsearch
performance tuning.</p>
<p>You need to clone or recreate an existing job if you want to optimize its search
query.</p>
<h4><a id="population-analysis"></a>13. Consider using population analysis<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Population analysis is more memory efficient than individual analysis of each
series. It builds a profile of what a "typical" entity does over a specified
time period and then identifies when one is behaving abnormally compared to the
population. Use population analysis for analyzing high cardinality fields if you
expect that the entities of the population generally behave in the same way.</p>
<h4><a id="forecasting"></a>14. Reduce the cost of forecasting<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/anomaly-detection/anomaly-detection-scale.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>There are two main performance factors to consider when you create a forecast:
indexing load and memory usage. Check the cluster monitoring data to learn the
indexing rate and the memory usage.</p>
<p>Forecasting writes a new document to the result index for every forecasted
element of the  for every bucket. Jobs with high partition or by field
cardinality create more result documents, as do jobs with small bucket span and
longer forecast duration. Only three concurrent forecasts may be run for a
single job.</p>
<p>To reduce indexing load, consider a shorter forecast duration and/or try to
avoid concurrent forecast requests. Further performance gains can be achieved by
reviewing the job configuration; for example by using a dedicated results index,
increasing the bucket span and/or by having lower cardinality partitioning
fields.</p>
<p>The memory usage of a forecast is restricted to 20 MB by default. From 7.9, you
can extend this limit by setting <code class="literal">max_model_memory</code> to a higher value. The
maximum value is 40% of the memory limit of the anomaly detection job or 500 MB. If the
forecast needs more memory than the provided value, it spools to disk. Forecasts
that spool to disk generally run slower. If you need to speed up forecasts,
increase the available memory for the forecast. Forecasts that would take more
than 500 MB to run won’t start because this is the maximum limit of disk space
that a forecast is allowed to use.</p>
