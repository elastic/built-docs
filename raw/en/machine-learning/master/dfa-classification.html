<p>Classification is a machine learning process that enables you to predict the class or
category of a data point in your data set. Typical examples of classification
problems are predicting loan risk, classifying music, or detecting the potential
for cancer in a DNA sequence. In the first case, for example, the data set might
contain the investment history, employment status, debit status, and other
financial details for loan applicants. Based on this data, you could use
classification analysis to create a model that predicts whether it is safe or risky to
lend money to applicants. In the second case, the data contains song details
that enable you to classify music into genres like hip-hop, country, or
classical, for example. Classification is for predicting discrete,
categorical values, whereas <a class="xref" href="dfa-regression.html" title="Regression">regression analysis</a> predicts
continuous, numerical values.</p>
<p>When you create a classification job, you must specify which field contains
the classes that you want to predict. This field is known as the <em>dependent variable</em>. It
must contain no more than 30 classes. By default, all other
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/put-dfanalytics.html#dfa-supported-fields" class="ulink" target="_top">supported fields</a> are included
in the analysis and are known as <em>feature variables</em>. The runtime and resources
used by the job increase with the number of feature variables. Therefore, you
can optionally include or exclude fields from the analysis. For more information
about field selection, see the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/explain-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">explain data frame analytics API</a>.</p>

<p>Classification – just like regression – is a supervised machine learning process.
When you create the data frame analytics job, you must provide a data set that contains
the <em>ground truth</em>. That is to say, your data set must contain the dependent variable
and the feature variables fields that are related to it. You can divide the data
set into training and testing data by specifying a <code class="literal">training_percent</code>. By
default when you use the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/put-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">create data frame analytics jobs API</a>, 100% of the
<a class="xref" href="ml-dfa-limitations.html#dfa-classification-field-type-docs-limitations" title="Classification field types">eligible documents</a> in the
data set are used for training. If you divide your data set, the job stratifies
the data to ensure that both the training and testing data sets contains classes
in proportions that are representative of the class proportions in the full data
set.</p>
<p>When you are collecting a data set to train your model, ensure that it
captures information for all of the classes. If some classes are poorly
represented in the training data set (that is, you have very few data points per
class), the model might be unaware of them. In general, complex decision
boundaries between classes are harder to learn and require more data points per
class in the training data.</p>

<p>Classification analysis uses an ensemble algorithm that is a type of boosting called
boosted tree regression model which combines multiple weak models into a
composite one. It uses decision trees to learn to predict the probability that a
data point belongs to a certain class. A sequence of decision trees are trained
and every decision tree learns from the mistakes of the previous one. Every tree
is an iteration of the last one, hence it improves the decision made by the
previous tree.</p>

<p>The model that you created is stored as Elasticsearch documents in internal indices. In
other words, the characteristics of your trained model are saved and ready to be
deployed and used as functions. The <a class="xref" href="ml-inference.html" title="Inference">inference</a> feature enables you
to use your model in a preprocessor of an ingest pipeline or in a pipeline
aggregation of a search query to make predictions about your data.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>As a rule of thumb, a classification analysis with many classes takes more time to run
than a binary classification process when there are only two classes. The
relationship between the number of classes and the runtime is roughly linear.</p>
<p>The runtime also scales approximately linearly with the number of involved
documents below 200,000 data points. Therefore, if you double the number of
documents, then the runtime of the analysis doubles respectively.</p>
<p>To improve the performance of your classification analysis, consider using a smaller
<code class="literal">training_percent</code> value when you create the job. That is to say, use a smaller
percentage of your documents to train the model more quickly. It is a good
strategy to make progress iteratively: use a smaller training percentage first,
run the analysis, and evaluate the performance. Then, based on the results,
decide if it is necessary to increase the <code class="literal">training_percent</code> value. If possible,
prepare your input data such that it has less classes. You can also remove the
fields that are not relevant from the analysis by specifying <code class="literal">excludes</code> patterns
in the <code class="literal">analyzed_fields</code> object when configuring the data frame analytics job.</p>

<p>The following sections help you understand and interpret the results of a

</div></div></div>
<p>The <code class="literal">class_probability</code> is a value between 0 and 1, which indicates how likely
it is that a given data point belongs to a certain class. The higher the number,
the higher the probability that the data point belongs to the named class. This
information is stored in the <code class="literal">top_classes</code> array for each document in your
destination index.</p>

<h4 class="title"><a id="dfa-classification-class-score"></a><code class="literal">class_score</code><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/master/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/dfa-classification.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
</div></div></div>
<p>The <code class="literal">class_score</code> is a function of the <code class="literal">class_probability</code> and has a value that
is greater than or equal to zero. It takes into consideration your objective (as
defined in the <code class="literal">class_assignment_objective</code> job configuration option):
<em>accuracy</em> or <em>recall</em>.</p>
<p>If your objective is to maximize accuracy, the scores are weighted to maximize
the proportion of correct predictions in the training data set. For example, in
the context of a binary <a class="xref" href="ml-dfanalytics-evaluate.html#ml-dfanalytics-confusion-matrix" title="Confusion matrix">confusion matrix</a>
with classes <code class="literal">false</code> and <code class="literal">true</code>, the predictions of interest are the cells where
the actual and predicted labels are both <code class="literal">true</code> (also known as a true positive
(TP)) or both <code class="literal">false</code> (also known as a true negative (TN)):</p>

</div>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If there is an imbalanced distribution of classes in your training data
set, focusing on accuracy can decrease your model&#8217;s sensitivity to incorrect
predictions in the classes that are under-represented in your data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>By default, classification analysis jobs accept a slight degradation of the overall
accuracy in return for greater sensitivity to classes that are predicted
incorrectly. That is to say, their objective is to maximize the minimum recall.
For example, in the context of a multi-class confusion matrix, the predictions
of interest are in each row:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/confusion-matrix-multiclass-recall.jpg" alt="A confusion matrix with a row highlighted">
</div>
</div>
<p>For each class, the recall is calculated as the number of correct predictions
(where the actual label matches the predicted label) divided by the sum of all
the other predicted labels in that row. This value is represented as a
percentage in each cell of the confusion matrix. The class scores are then
weighted to favor predictions that result in the highest recall values across
the training data. This objective typically performs better than accuracy when
you have highly imbalanced data.</p>

<p>You can measure how well the model has performed on your data set by using the
<code class="literal">classification</code> evaluation type of the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/evaluate-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">evaluate data frame analytics API</a>. The metric that the
evaluation provides you is a confusion matrix. The more classes you have, the
more complex the confusion matrix is. The matrix tells you how many data points
that belong to a given class were classified correctly and incorrectly.</p>
<p>If you split your data set into training and testing data, you can determine how
well your model performs on data it has never seen before and compare the
prediction to the actual value.</p>
