<p>Outlier detection is identification of data points that are significantly
different from other values in the data set. For example, outliers could be
errors or unusual entities in a data set. Outlier detection is an unsupervised
machine learning technique, there is no need to provide training data.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Outlier detection is a batch analysis, it runs against your data
once. If new data comes into the index, you need to do the analysis again on the
altered data.</p>

<h3><a id="dfa-outlier-algorithms"></a>Outlier detection algorithms<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In the Elastic Stack, we use an ensemble of four different distance and density based
outlier detection methods:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
distance of K<sup>th</sup> nearest neighbor: computes the distance of the data point to
its K<sup>th</sup> nearest neighbor where K is a small number and usually independent of
the total number of data points.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
distance of K-nearest neighbors: calculates the average distance of the data
points to their nearest neighbors. Points with the largest average distance will
be the most outlying.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
local outlier factor (<code class="literal">lof</code>): takes into account the distance of the points to
their K nearest neighbors and also the distance of these neighbors to their
neighbors.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
local distance-based outlier factor (<code class="literal">ldof</code>): is a ratio of two measures: the
first computes the average distance of the data point to its K nearest
neighbors; the second computes the average of the pairwise distances of the
neighbors themselves.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to select the methods or provide any parameters, but you can
override the default behavior if you like. <em>Distance based methods</em> assume
that normal data points remain closer or similar in value while outliers are
located far away or significantly differ in value. The drawback of these methods
is that they don&#8217;t take into account the density variations of a data set.
<em>Density based methods</em> are used for mitigating this problem.</p>
<p>The four algorithms don&#8217;t always agree on which points are outliers. By default,
outlier detection jobs use all these methods, then normalize and combine their
results and give every data point in the index an outlier score. The outlier score ranges
from 0 to 1, where the higher number represents the chance that the data point
is an outlier compared to the other data points in the index.</p>
<h4><a id="dfa-feature-influence"></a>Feature influence<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Feature influence – another score calculated while detecting outliers – provides
a relative ranking of the different features and their contribution towards a
point being an outlier. This score allows you to understand the context or
the reasoning on why a certain data point is an outlier.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-outlier-detection-problem"></a>1. Define the problem<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Outlier detection in the Elastic Stack can be used to detect any unusual entity in a
given population. For example, to detect malicious software on a machine or
unusual user behavior on a network. As outlier detection operates on the assumption
that the outliers make up a small proportion of the overall data population, you
can use this feature in such cases. Outlier detection is a batch analysis that
works best on an entity-centric index. If your use case is based on time series
data, you might want to use <a class="xref" href="ml-ad-overview.html" title="Anomaly detection">anomaly detection</a>
instead.</p>
<p>The machine learning features provide unsupervised outlier detection, which means there is no
need to provide a training data set.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-outlier-detection-environment"></a>2. Set up the environment<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Before you can use the Elastic Stack machine learning features, there are some configuration
requirements (such as security privileges) that must be addressed. Refer to
<a class="xref" href="setup.html" title="Set up machine learning features"><em>Setup and security</em></a>.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-outlier-detection-prepare-data"></a>3. Prepare and transform data<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Outlier detection requires specifically structured source data: a two
dimensional tabular data structure. For this reason, you might need to
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/transforms.html" class="ulink" target="_top">transform</a> your data to create a data frame which can
be used as the source for outlier detection.</p>
<p>You can find an example of how to transform your data into an entity-centric
index in <a class="xref" href="ml-dfa-finding-outliers.html#weblogs-outliers" title="Detecting unusual behavior in the logs data set">this section</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="dfa-outlier-detection-create-job"></a>4. Create a job<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Data frame analytics jobs contain the configuration information and metadata
necessary to perform an analytics task. You can create data frame analytics jobs via
Kibana or using the <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/put-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">create data frame analytics jobs API</a>.
Select outlier detection as the analytics type that the data frame analytics job performs.
You can also decide to include and exclude fields to/from the analysis when you
create the job.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>You can view the statistics of the selectable fields in the data frame analytics
wizard. The field statistics displayed in a flyout provide more meaningful
context to help you select relevant fields.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><a id="dfa-outlier-detection-start"></a>5. Start the job<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You can start the job via Kibana or using the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/start-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">start data frame analytics jobs</a> API. An outlier detection job
has four phases:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">reindexing</code>: documents are copied from the source index to the destination
index.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">loading_data</code>: the job fetches the necessary data from the destination index.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">computing_outliers</code>: the job identifies outliers in the data.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">writing_results</code>: the job matches the results with the data rows in the
destination index, merges them, and indexes them back to the destination
index.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>After the last phase is finished, the job stops and the results are ready for
evaluation.</p>
<p>Outlier detection jobs – unlike other data frame analytics jobs – run one time in their
life cycle. If you&#8217;d like to run the analysis again, you need to create a new
job.</p>
<h3><a id="ml-outlier-detection-evaluate"></a>6. Evaluate the results<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Using the data frame analytics features to gain insights from a data set is an
iterative process. After you defined the problem you want to solve, and chose
the analytics type that can help you to do so, you need to produce a
high-quality data set and create the appropriate data frame analytics job. You might
need to experiment with different configurations, parameters, and ways to
transform data before you arrive at a result that satisfies your use case. A
valuable companion to this process is the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/evaluate-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">evaluate data frame analytics API</a>, which enables you to evaluate
the data frame analytics performance. It helps you understand error distributions and
identifies the points where the data frame analytics model performs well or less
trustworthily.</p>
<p>To evaluate the analysis with this API, you need to annotate your index that
contains the results of the analysis with a field that marks each document with
the ground truth. The evaluate data frame analytics API evaluates the performance of the
data frame analytics against this manually provided ground truth.</p>
<p>The outlier detection evaluation type offers the following metrics to evaluate the
model performance:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
confusion matrix
</li>
<li class="listitem">
precision
</li>
<li class="listitem">
recall
</li>
<li class="listitem">
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4><a id="ml-dfanalytics-confusion-matrix"></a>Confusion matrix<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>A confusion matrix provides four measures of how well the data frame analytics worked
on your data set:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
True positives (TP): Class members that the analysis identified as class
members.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
True negatives (TN): Not class members that the analysis identified as not
class members.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
False positives (FP): Not class members that the analysis misidentified as
class members.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
False negatives (FN): Class members that the analysis misidentified as not
class members.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Although, the evaluate data frame analytics API can compute the confusion matrix out of the
analysis results, these results are not binary values (class member/not
class member), but a number between 0 and 1 (which called the outlier score in case
of outlier detection). This value captures how likely it is for a data point to be a
member of a certain class. It means that it is up to the user to decide what is
the threshold or cutoff point at which the data point will be considered as a
member of the given class. For example, the user can say that all the data
points with an outlier score higher than 0.5 will be considered as outliers.</p>
<p>To take this complexity into account, the evaluate data frame analytics API returns the confusion
matrix at different thresholds (by default, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75).</p>
<h4><a id="ml-dfanalytics-precision-recall"></a>Precision and recall<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Precision and recall values summarize the algorithm performance as a single
number that makes it easier to compare the evaluation results.</p>
<p>Precision shows how many of the data points that were identified as class
members are actually class members. It is the number of true positives divided
by the sum of the true positives and false positives (TP/(TP+FP)).</p>
<p>Recall shows how many of the data points that are actual class members were
identified correctly as class members. It is the number of true positives
divided by the sum of the true positives and false negatives (TP/(TP+FN)).</p>
<p>Precision and recall are computed at different threshold levels.</p>
<h4><a id="ml-dfanalytics-roc"></a>Receiver operating characteristic curve<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a plot that represents the
performance of the binary classification process at different thresholds. It
compares the rate of true positives against the rate of false positives at the
different threshold levels to create the curve. From this plot, you can compute
the area under the curve (AUC) value, which is a number between 0 and 1. The
closer to 1, the better the algorithm performance.</p>
<p>The evaluate data frame analytics API can return the false positive rate (<code class="literal">fpr</code>) and the true
positive rate (<code class="literal">tpr</code>) at the different threshold levels, so you can visualize
the algorithm performance by using these values.</p>
<h3><a id="weblogs-outliers"></a>Detecting unusual behavior in the logs data set<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/main/docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-dfa-outlier-detection.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The goal of outlier detection is to find the most unusual documents in an index.
Let&#8217;s try to detect unusual behavior in the
<a href="/guide/en/kibana/master/get-started.html#gs-get-data-into-kibana" class="ulink" target="_top">data logs sample data set</a>.</p>

<code class="literal">111.237.144.54</code> indicates that the sum of the exchanged bytes was the most
influential feature in determining that that client IP is an outlier.</p>
<p>If you want to see the exact feature influence values, you can retrieve them
from the index that is associated with your data frame analytics job.</p>

<p>Kibana also provides a scatterplot matrix in the results. Outliers with a score
that exceeds the threshold are highlighted in each chart. The outlier score
threshold can be set by using the slider under the matrix:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/outliers-scatterplot.jpg" alt="View scatterplot in outlier detection results">
</div>
</div>
<p>You can highlight an area in one of the charts and the corresponding area is
also highlighted in the rest of the charts. This function makes it easier to
focus on specific values and areas in the results. In addition to the sample
size and random scoring options, there is a <span class="strong strong"><strong>Dynamic size</strong></span> option. If you enable
this option, the size of each point is affected by its outlier score; that is to
say, the largest points have the highest outlier scores. The goal of these charts
and options is to help you visualize and explore the outliers within your data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve found unusual behavior in the sample data set, consider how you
might apply these steps to other data sets. If you have data that is already
marked up with true outliers, you can determine how well the outlier detection
algorithms perform by using the evaluate data frame analytics API. See

<p>If you do not want to keep the transform and the data frame analytics job, you
can delete them in Kibana or use the

<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/delete-dfanalytics.html" class="ulink" target="_top">delete data frame analytics job API</a>. When you delete
transforms and data frame analytics jobs in Kibana, you have the option to also remove
the destination indices and data views.</p>
