<p>In 7.10, we are delighted to announce the release of User Experience monitoring
capabilities featuring Google Core Web Vitals. These Core Web Vitals are based on metrics
that score three crucial areas of user experience: loading performance, visual stability,
and interactivity. Core Web Vitals are set to become the leading performance measurement in Google ranking
factors, <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/11/timing-for-page-experience.html" class="ulink" target="_top">beginning in May 2021</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to Core Web Vitals, we provide several other data points to help you understand
how users are experiencing your website. You can filter and break down data to focus
on the parts of your website or groups of users who are having a poor experience.

<h3><a id="_real_browser_synthetics_in_uptime_experimental"></a>Real-browser synthetics in Uptime (experimental)<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In 7.10, we are introducing scripted multi-step monitors to Uptime with our experimental
synthetic real-browser based agent. Using simple Javascript, you can create new monitors that execute
scripted journeys and interactions through critical functions of your website. You can also run the
agent within your internal networks without the need to open holes in your firewalls—perfect for
monitoring critical internal apps.</p>
<p>Our real browser synthetic agent has the same resource-based pricing as before, so no need for the
per test run pricing offered by most vendors on the market.</p>
<p>We have also greatly improved the developer experience. With our new scripted agent, you can run tests
locally and debug using Chrome dev tools. You can now write your synthetic tests alongside your web app,
test locally, and then promote those tests as code alongside your production pushes—no more gaps between
dev and ops. For more information, see <a href="/what-is/synthetic-monitoring" class="ulink" target="_top">Synthetics monitoring</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="_fleet_beta_2"></a>Fleet (beta 2)<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>As of 7.10, we are releasing our second beta version of Fleet and Elastic Agent. This release
includes the new capability to upgrade Elastic Agent binaries inside Fleet. You can view and select the
agents that are out of date, and then select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Upgrade agents</strong></span> to trigger the agent to download,
install, and run the new version.</p>
<p>This approach simplifies the process of keeping your agents up to date. It also saves you time as you
don’t need to manage an upgrade process using third-party tools or processes. As part of this new
capability, we have released a new installer as a <span class="strong strong"><strong>Basic</strong></span> tier feature that configures a service to start
the agent on system reboot. This new installer ensures the agent binary upgrades in Fleet. It&#8217;s an experimental feature,
so we&#8217;re looking forward to your feedback as you test it out.</p>
<p>We are also releasing new features that enable you to apply actions to multiple agents. Select any
combination of agents to assign a new policy to, unenroll agents, or upgrade agent binaries. This is useful
for progressive or canary deployments of agent upgrades, migrating hosts to new policies in bulk, and much
more. To give you more selective control over large numbers of agents, we are releasing these features in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Gold</strong></span> tier.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">

<h3><a id="_anomaly_detection_for_hosts_and_kubernetes_pods"></a>Anomaly detection for hosts and Kubernetes pods<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>An essential piece of a modern monitoring solution is the ability to auto-detect any abnormal behavior
in your infrastructure before something bad happens. As of 7.10, we have added out of the
box anomaly detection that automatically detects if a host or a Kubernetes pod is experiencing unusual
symptoms—for example, spiking CPU, anomalous outbound traffic, memory leaks, etc. This is to help your
infrastructure ops teams monitor their fleet of resources, and spot failing resources with minimal manual effort.</p>
<p>The anomalies detected by the machine learning jobs are displayed in the infrastructure map view in the Metrics app.
This makes it easier for you to spot a troubled container or namespace in a sea of resources. You can view when
resources are behaving unusually versus when a metric is just high or low on an absolute scale. For example,
when the CPU suddenly spikes to 50%, it may be a more worrisome signal than when the maximum CPU is at 85%.</p>
<p>We have also included a historical timeline in the Metrics app to help you see the full alert and anomaly
timeline across your resource pool, making it easy to spot temporal trends and patterns during an incident
investigation. You can use the timeline to explore the state of your infrastructure at the point in time the
incident occurred. For more information,
see <a href="/guide/en/observability/7.10/inspect-metric-anomalies.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Inspect metric anomalies</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="_multi_cloud_billing_for_aws_azure_and_google_cloud"></a>Multi-cloud billing for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elastic already provides integrations for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud that can be used to monitor any cloud
service. As of 7.10, we have extended these cloud integrations to include billing information. You
can monitor your cost and estimated charges across the cloud providers without having to switch between different
cloud consoles or going through other data points.</p>
<p>Use the Elastic integrations for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to automatically collect billing information, send it
to Elasticsearch, and display it in Kibana. All the integrations come with dashboards that visualize the billing and usage
metrics. To see how your operations correlate with the incurred cost, you can reuse the visualizations by placing
them side by side with your other operational data points.</p>

<p>For AWS, the billing and usage metrics are collected from both CloudWatch and Cost Explorer. CloudWatch gives an
estimated charge for each month, and Cost Explorer gives accurate daily expenses instead of an estimated value.
For Azure, the data is collected from cost management. And for Google Cloud, the detailed billing data is exported
to a specified BigQuery dataset before it is scraped for detailed analysis.</p>
<h3><a id="_logs_ratio_alerting"></a>Logs ratio alerting<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When creating threshold-based alerts, you may want to weigh them by another metric. To achieve this, we have
introduced logs ratio alerting in the Logs app. For example, when detecting a genuine web server timeout problem
(504 gateway timeout errors), you can weigh them with the number of requests it handles. To help achieve this, you
create a ratio threshold like <code class="literal">Ratio between error code 504 to the overall number of response codes is higher than a threshold</code>.

<p>We have also included an alert chart preview. When creating a threshold alert, you want to set a value that
triggers when it detects an outlier. The alert chart preview enables you to visualize the threshold overlaid on
top of historical data. For more information, see <a href="/guide/en/observability/7.10/logs-threshold-alert.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Alerting</a>.</p>

<p>In 7.6.0, we introduced <a href="/blog/elastic-logs-7-6-0-released" class="ulink" target="_top">log categorization</a>, a powerful tool
that works well with machine-generated unstructured data and not as much for free-form text.
In 7.10, we have added the ability to identify inadequate datasets for categorization. On the Categories
page of the Logs app, a warning is displayed describing the specific dataset that is a misfit for categorization
and provides a link to configure the job for filtering that dataset.</p>

<p>In 7.7.0 we announced the beta release of the Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) integration, which included an out-of-the-box
PCF operator and developer observability. As of 7.10, we have included PCF logs integration. This
follows working closely with customers to test functional and scaling aspects of PCF observability.</p>

<p>The Elastic Stack monitoring features provide a way to keep a pulse on the health and performance of your Elasticsearch cluster.
In previous releases, you could use Watcher and create custom alerts on the collected monitoring data.</p>
<p>As of 7.10, we have added out-of-the-box Kibana alerts to notify you of potential issues in the Elastic Stack.
Within Kibana, the CPU threshold, Disk Usage, Memory Usage (JVM), and Missing monitoring data alerts are preconfigured
and available for selection. The alerts are also visible alongside your existing Watcher cluster alerts in the
Stack monitoring UI.</p>
<p>Each alert is preconfigured based on the best practices recommended by Elastic. However, you can <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enter setup mode</strong></span>
and tailor them to meet your specific needs, including alert conditions and actions. Stack monitoring not only helps
you create the alerts but also provides suggestions for investigative workflows to make this a powerful debugging tool.</p>

<h3><a id="_apm_service_maps"></a>APM service maps<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.10/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In 7.7.0, we introduced the service maps functionality into APM, and since then we have added data to make the maps
more actionable. We added health indicators to make it easier for you to determine the health of your instrumented
services and filtering to enable you to slice these maps based on your environments.</p>
<p>As of 7.10, we are delighted to announce the general availability of service maps. This release provides
a new layout to the maps. Curved connectors make it easier to visualize the connections between services.</p>
<p>Also, you can drag nodes into a structure that is easier for you to understand. To minimize the noise on the maps
and make them easier to navigate, multiple external service calls are automatically collapsed into groups to
display the relationships between sets of services and external connections.</p>

<p>In 7.10, we have added health indicators to the service inventory view. Powered by the APM machine learning integration,
these health indicators help spot services that need attention quickly. In addition to this, we have added a sparkline
chart to the inventory view to help you understand the historical performance of your service.</p>

<p>In 7.10, we have made the APM machine learning integration more actionable by adding the capability to create alerts
on this data. While static thresholds are great for creating basic alerts, they can potentially cause a lot of noise
when the underlying data is expected to be bursty. The new alert based on anomaly detection enables you to create alerts
that take bursty or seasonal traffic patterns into account and notify a user only when true anomalies are detected.</p>

<p>We are excited to introduce the PHP agent as a beta to Elastic APM. With this new agent, you get instant visibility
into the performance of your PHP applications. The addition of the PHP agent now extends our support of all the major
application development languages, which includes Java, .NET, GO, Python, Ruby, and Javascript.</p>

<p>With the Java agent release 1.18.0, we have added support for automatic metrics collection from Micrometer. The
metrics include cache statistics, thread pools, page hits, and also your custom business-related metrics, such as
revenue which you can view in Kibana. For information on how to set up and start collecting these
metrics, see our <a href="/guide/en/apm/agent/java/current/metrics.html#metrics-micrometer" class="ulink" target="_top">Micrometer documentation</a>.</p>

<p>We extended the <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/exporter/elasticexporter" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic exporter</a>
for OpenTelemetry Collector to collect metrics and export them to the APM server. The Elastic OpenTelemetry exporter
now supports both traces and metrics collection. OpenTelemetry metrics help to monitor business KPIs and technical
components that are not auto instrumented by the OpenTelemetry SDK.</p>
<p>Capturing insightful business metrics on applications with OpenTelemetry looks like this:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-opentelemetry">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-opentelemetry">// initialize metric
Meter meter = OpenTelemetry.getMeter("my-frontend-frontend");
DoubleValueRecorder orderValueRecorder = meter.doubleValueRecorderBuilder("order").build();

<p>In 7.10, we have included the beta release of a new disk <a href="/guide/en/beats/filebeat/7.10/configuring-internal-queue.html" class="ulink" target="_top">queue</a>
that stores the pending events on disk rather than the main memory. This enables Beats to queue a larger number of events
than what is possible with the memory queue, and also to save events when a Beat or device restarts. It provides increased
availability and reliability for cases like transient errors of the output; for example, when Elasticsearch is not available for some time.</p>
