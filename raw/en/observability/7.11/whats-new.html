<h3><a id="_apm_and_logs"></a>APM and logs<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.11/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Inspecting application log data and contextual traces can be extremely helpful to
troubleshoot a performance problem quickly. Since 7.5, the APM app has offered an
easy navigation option that allows you to navigate from your distributed traces into the logs.</p>
<p>For 7.11, we have two exciting announcements:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Elastic Common Schema (ECS) logging libraries are now generally available! You can now use
ECS logger plugins to format your logs into ECS-compatible JSON. Using these libraries, along
with an Elastic APM agent, means that you do not have any manual configuration to correlate
logs to your application traces.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Embedded trace logs are now available in the curated APM app, which means you no longer have
to navigate outside the trace view to visualize your application logs. These contextualized
and correlated logs quickly point you to the underlying issues within your application.

<h3><a id="_enhanced_host_details_view"></a>Enhanced host details view<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.11/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Monitoring large infrastructures can be a complicated and time-consuming task. To get to the
root cause of a problem, you may need to analyze multiple data streams from various
infrastructure parts and keep track of related information. To help you minimize the time
it takes to troubleshoot a problem, you want quick access to all the relevant details on
the host, including the main KPIs, processes running on the host, logs originating from it,
and other detailed host information.</p>
<p>In 7.11, we’re delighted to introduce an enhanced view of hosts or VMs to the
Metrics app. Without leaving the Inventory page, you can view the following information about the host or VM:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Time charts of key host metrics: CPU, memory, load, and network
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Logs generated by the host or the services running on the host
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Top processes running on the host by CPU or memory
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Host metadata: host, cloud, and agent information
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The enhanced host details help accelerate root cause analysis by tightly aligning how the
information is presented and accessed to a typical investigative workflow. This makes it
easier for infrastructure ops teams to monitor and troubleshoot infrastructure issues.</p>

<h3><a id="_synthetics_waterfall_view"></a>Synthetics waterfall view<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.11/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When a webpage loads, what the end user sees on the screen is the combination of hundreds
of HTML files, images, web fonts, Javascript, and other media objects. Browsers need to
connect to servers, download, parse, and then render each of these for the user to do what
they came to the website to do. There are many moving parts, and this is why a synthetic
monitoring product must have the ability to see the object by object load of the website.</p>
<p>In 7.11, we’re excited to release the first iteration of our page load waterfall that
displays each object&#8217;s connection stats. This iteration is a significant increase in
functionality for our users, along with some unique capabilities in the market. There
is a lot more coming in subsequent releases!</p>

<h3><a id="_runtime_fields_in_logs"></a>Runtime fields in logs<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.11/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>For 7.11, we are delighted to announce that Elasticsearch now supports creating
runtime fields in the Elastic Stack. Once a runtime field is created, for example, the
<code class="literal">day_of_week</code> field, you can view and filter them in the Logs app&#8217;s stream page,
just like standard fields.</p>

<h3><a id="_fleet_and_elastic_agent_beta_3"></a>Fleet and Elastic Agent (Beta 3)<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.11/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In 7.11, we’re excited to release our third beta of Fleet and Elastic Agent.
So you can identify and troubleshoot issues faster, we have added better observability
to Elastic Agent integrations, logs, and metrics. This helps you gain visibility into
issues with Elastic Agent right inside the Fleet app.</p>
<p>The agent details page now shows information about the agent settings, the host, and
which integrations are running.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/elastic-agent.png" alt="Elastic agent page">
</div>
</div>
<p>Additionally, the status information from the Elastic Agent is now available in Elasticsearch.
We added a simple log viewer that lets you easily search and filter. It is only compatible
with Elastic Agents version 7.11 or higher. For a richer experience, you can also open
the Logs app to view the logs.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/elastic-agent-logs.png" alt="Elastic agent logs">
</div>
</div>
<p>For more in-depth insight when troubleshooting, we’ve made it easier to debug logging.
At the bottom of the page, you can change the log level for the agent. You can
apply it selectively on a per-agent basis to avoid sending a high volume of data from all your agents.</p>
<p>We’ve also improved agent binary upgrades. To ensure that the agent remains functioning
and reachable from the Fleet app, we will automatically roll the agent back to the
previous version during an upgrade, if it has an error.</p>
<p>Finally, Elastic Agent can self-protect when the Endpoint Security integration is enabled.
Self-protection means that Endpoint Security guards against users and attackers interfering
with Elastic Agent’s functionality. Over time, we will enhance these guards to prevent
interference with Elastic Agent.</p>

<p>In 7.11, the APM Python agent learned a new trick! The latest version can
automatically detect and monitor Prometheus metrics by auto-instrumentation of the
Prometheus Python library.</p>
<p>Your application custom metrics are now monitored with zero
effort whenever you monitor your Python applications with APM. Once you hook up custom
metrics, you can quickly build a Kibana dashboard using TSVB or Lens to analyze them
and correlate with other performance metrics.</p>

<p>For 7.11, the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/plugins/elastic-logging-plugin" class="ulink" target="_top">Docker logging plugin</a>
for enabling a simpler user experience for application logging is now generally available.</p>
<p>You can use the Elastic Logging Plugin for Docker to forward logs to Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kafka, or Redis,
for all Docker containers or on a per-container basis. Unlike other Beats, the Elastic Logging Plugin for Docker requires no
elevated permissions to read container logs, and the installation is performed entirely
within the Docker CLI.</p>

<p>If you’re running Amazon’s ECS or EKS, the chances are you’re using AWS Fargate to manage these
deployments, because Fargate removes the responsibility of provisioning and managing the
underlying EC2 infrastructure. You only need to specify your containers and tasks.</p>
<p>In 7.11, we’ve added a metric collection from AWS Fargate service to our cloud integrations list.
The new <a href="/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/7.11/metricbeat-module-awsfargate.html" class="ulink" target="_top">AWS <code class="literal">fargate</code></a> Metricbeat module collects
container metrics and metadata from the Fargate task metadata endpoints and allows you to
monitor containers inside the same AWS Fargate task.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">fargate</code> module comes with a prebuilt dashboard where you can see all your containers and
their key metrics in a given cluster or region, giving you an overview of all your Fargate tasks.</p>

<p>For 7.11, we are delighted to announce the Kibana alerting framework&#8217;s general availability.
It has been in beta for the past few minor releases, during which we have improved scalability and architecture.</p>
<p>With Kibana alerting integrated with Elastic Observability, you can create alerts and route
notifications to external systems for further triaging.</p>
