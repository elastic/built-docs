<p>Synthetic monitoring via Elastic Agent and Fleet requires Fleet Server to be set up. If you are using Elastic Cloud fleet server will already be provided and you can skip this step. To learn more, see <a href="/guide/en/fleet/7.15/fleet-quick-start.html#set-up-fleet" class="ulink" target="_top">Fleet</a>.</p>

<p>Use a separate fleet policy for Synthetics monitors in most cases. It is generally the case that synthetics monitors should run on nodes dedicated to that purpose. See <a href="/guide/en/fleet/7.15/agent-policy.html#create-a-policy" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Agent policy</a> for more information on Fleet policies and creating them.</p>

<p>Elastic Agent is a single, unified agent that you can deploy to hosts or containers to collect data and send it to the Elastic Stack. Behind the scenes, Elastic Agent runs Beats or Elastic Endpoint required for your configuration.</p>
<p>To run synthetics tests, you must use the <span class="strong strong"><strong>elastic-agent-complete</strong></span> Docker image to create a self-hosted Elastic Agent node. This image contains the dependencies to run synthetic monitors. The standard Elastic Cloud or self-hosted Elastic Agent will not work.</p>
<p>To add an Elastic Agent to Fleet, you&#8217;ll need an enrollment token and the URL of your fleet server. You can use the default enrollment token for your policy or create new enrollment tokens as needed. To learn more, see <a href="/guide/en/fleet/7.15/elastic-agent-container.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Run Elastic Elastic Agent in a container</a> and <a href="/guide/en/fleet/7.15/fleet-enrollment-tokens.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Fleet enrollment tokens</a> for more information. Please note that you must run the docker container as a non-root user for Browser monitors. See <a class="xref" href="synthetics-quickstart-fleet.html#synthetics-quickstart-fleet-security" title="Note on Sandboxing and Security">Note on Sandboxing and Security</a>  for more information on security requirements and compatibility within the container.</p>
<p>You may need to set additional environment variables. See the <a href="/guide/en/fleet/7.15/agent-environment-variables.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Agent environment variables guide</a> for more information. See <a href="/guide/en/fleet/7.15/elastic-agent-container.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Run Elastic Agent in a container</a> for more information on running Elastic Agent with Docker.</p>

<p>In the example above, our library of synthetic tests is downloaded from the
remote zip endpoint for <a href="https://github.com/elastic/synthetics-demo/tree/main/todos/synthetics-tests" class="ulink" target="_top">our todos example</a>.
The fields should be set as follows:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Zip URL</strong></span>: URL pointing to a zip file containing the test project.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Folder</strong></span>: The folder within the zip file containing synthetics tests, this will be the working directory in which the synthetics agent will be run. Heartbeat will invoke the synthetics library in this folder.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Zip URL Username</strong></span> and <span class="strong strong"><strong>Zip URL Password</strong></span> HTTP Basic Authentication headers for the remote zip endpoint.

<p>When applying the integration policy to an Elastic Agent policy, make sure to select your dedicated synthetics agent policy.</p>

<h4><a id="synthetics-quickstart-fleet-view-in-kib"></a>View in Kibana<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/7.15/docs/en/observability/synthetics-quickstart-fleet.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>That&#8217;s it! Elastic synthetics is now sending synthetic monitoring data to the Elastic Stack.
Navigate to the Uptime app in Kibana, where you can see screenshots of each run,
set up alerts in case of test failures, and more.</p>
<p>If a test does fail (shown as <code class="literal">down</code> in the app), you&#8217;ll be able to view the step script that failed,
any errors, and a stack trace.
See <a class="xref" href="synthetics-visualize.html" title="Visualize synthetic monitoring">Visualize</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Synthetics Browser checks can only run as the non-root <code class="literal">elastic-agent</code> user  in the <code class="literal">elastic-agent</code> container. Synthetics ICMP checks, on the other hand, require running as the root user. We are currently working to simplify the permissions requirements to work with a single user. This can be tracked in <a href="https://github.com/elastic/beats/issues/27920" class="ulink" target="_top">this github issue</a>.</p>
<p>Elastic synthetics runs Chromium without the extra protection of its process <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux/sandboxing.md" class="ulink" target="_top">sandbox</a> for greater compatibility with Linux server distributions. This is generally safe when run against sites whose content you trust when using a recent version of Elastic Synthetics and Chromium. A malicious site could leverage a sandbox escape which could lead to a compromise of the Elastic Agent container running synthetics, and any sensitive data within.</p>
