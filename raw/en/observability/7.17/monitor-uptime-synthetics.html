<p>The Uptime app in Kibana lets you monitor user journeys and full page loads using our browser monitor,
and also monitor the availability and response times of applications and services using our lightweight HTTP/S,
TCP, and ICMP monitors.</p>

</span> Real browser synthetic monitoring enables you to test critical actions and requests that an end-user would perform
on your site at predefined intervals and in a controlled environment. You can view each synthetic monitoring journey
in the Uptime app side-by-side with your other <a class="xref" href="monitor-uptime.html" title="Lightweight synthetic monitoring">Uptime monitors</a>. The result is rich, consistent, and repeatable
data that you can trend and alert on.</p>
<p>For example, test popular user journeys, like logging in, adding items to a cart, and checking
out&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;actions that need to work for your users consistently.</p>
<p>Alerting ensures that any degraded performance or broken actions are fixed before impacting your bottom line or customer
experience.</p>
