<p>This functionality is experimental and may be changed or removed completely in a future release.
Elastic will take a best effort approach to fix any issues, but experimental features are not subject
to the support SLA of official GA features.</p>

<p>The waterfall chart provides a visualization of every request the page made when
a user executed it. Each line in the chart represents an HTTP network request and
helps you quickly identify what resources are taking the longest to load and in what
order they are loading.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/synthetics-waterfall.png" alt="Synthetics waterfall chart">
</div>
</div>
<p>The colored bars within each line indicate the time spent per resource. Each color
represents a different part of that resource&#8217;s loading process and
includes the time spent downloading content for specific Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) types: HTML, JS, CSS, Media, Font, XHR, and Other.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand each phase of a request so you can improve your site&#8217;s
speed by reducing the time spent in each one.</p>

<p>Without leaving the waterfall chart, you can view data points relating to each resource:
resource details, request headers, response headers, and certificate headers. On the
waterfall chart, select a resource name, or any part of each row, to display the
resource details overlay.</p>
<p>For additional analysis, whether to check the content of a CSS file or to view a specific image,
click <span class="image"><img src="images/url-link-icon.png" alt="View page"></span> located beside each resource,
to view its content in a new tab.</p>
<p>You can also navigate between steps and checks at the top of the page to view the
corresponding waterfall charts.</p>

<p>To help you quickly identify resources that impact your user experience, you can combine
searching for a network request name with the automated filter options to focus on specific MIME types.</p>

<p>You can filter by XHR, HTML, JS, CSS, Font, and Media, to highlight the waterfall chart&#8217;s matching

<p>User journeys that are tested with synthetic monitoring need to consistently work for your users.
Alerting ensures any degraded performance or broken actions are fixed prior to impacts on your
bottom line or customers' experience.</p>
