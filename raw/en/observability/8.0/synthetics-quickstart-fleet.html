<p>Synthetic monitoring via Elastic Agent and Fleet requires Fleet Server to be set up. If you are using Elastic Cloud fleet server will already be provided and you can skip this step.

<p>Use a separate fleet policy for Synthetics monitors in most cases. It is generally the case that synthetics monitors should run on nodes dedicated to that purpose. See <a href="/guide/en/fleet/8.0/agent-policy.html#create-a-policy" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Agent policy</a> for more information on Fleet policies and creating them.</p>

<p>Elastic Agent is a single, unified agent that you can deploy to hosts or containers to collect data and send it to the Elastic Stack. Behind the scenes, Elastic Agent runs Beats or Elastic Endpoint required for your configuration.</p>
<p>To run synthetics tests, you must use the <span class="strong strong"><strong>elastic-agent-complete</strong></span> Docker image to create a self-hosted Elastic Agent node. This image contains the dependencies to run synthetic monitors. The standard Elastic Cloud or self-hosted Elastic Agent will not work.</p>
<p>To add an Elastic Agent to Fleet, you&#8217;ll need an enrollment token and the URL of your fleet server. You can use the default enrollment token for your policy or create new enrollment tokens as needed. To learn more, see <a href="/guide/en/fleet/8.0/elastic-agent-container.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Run Elastic Agent in a container</a> and <a href="/guide/en/fleet/8.0/fleet-enrollment-tokens.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Fleet enrollment tokens</a> for more information.</p>
<p>You may need to set additional environment variables. See the <a href="/guide/en/fleet/8.0/agent-environment-variables.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Agent environment variables guide</a> for more information. See <a href="/guide/en/fleet/8.0/elastic-agent-container.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Run Elastic Agent in a container</a> for more information on running Elastic Agent with Docker.</p>

</span> Elastic Synthetics tests can be configured through Fleet using the Elastic Synthetics integration.

<p>In the example above, our library of synthetic tests is downloaded from the
remote zip endpoint for the git repository for <a href="https://github.com/elastic/synthetics-demo/tree/main/todos/synthetics-tests" class="ulink" target="_top">our todos example</a>.</p>
<p>By using a git repository for synthetics journeys, we can benefit from a GitOps workflow for deploying changes to  synthetic monitors, enabling git features such as pull requests, reverts, etc. for managing tests more effectively.</p>
<p>The fields should be set as follows:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Zip URL</strong></span>: URL pointing to a zip file containing the test project.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Folder</strong></span>: The folder within the zip file containing synthetics tests. This will be the working directory in which the synthetics agent runs. Heartbeat will invoke the synthetics library in this folder.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Zip URL Username</strong></span> and <span class="strong strong"><strong>Zip URL Password</strong></span> HTTP Basic Authentication headers for the remote zip endpoint.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Params</strong></span> JSON formatted dynamic values that may be required by your specific tests. See <a class="xref" href="synthetics-params-secrets.html" title="Working with params and secrets">Working with parameters and secrets</a> for more information.

<p>When applying the integration policy to an Elastic Agent policy, make sure to select your dedicated synthetics agent policy.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! Elastic synthetics is now sending synthetic monitoring data to the Elastic Stack.
Navigate to the Uptime app in Kibana, where you can see screenshots of each run,
set up alerts in case of test failures, and more.</p>
<p>If a test does fail (shown as <code class="literal">down</code> in the app), you&#8217;ll be able to view the step script that failed,
any errors, and a stack trace.
