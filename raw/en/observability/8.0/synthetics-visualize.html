on the monitor <span class="strong strong"><strong>Overview</strong></span> page. You can examine journey details, including its
availability, monitor ID, service availability per monitoring location, the timing
for each synthetic check performed, and check statuses over time.</p>
<p>The <span class="strong strong"><strong>History</strong></span> table lists the total count of all of the synthetic checks that completed or failed
during the journey. The timestamp for each check is also displayed, along with its duration.
For any failed checks, the error and the failed step are displayed.</p>

<p>The waterfall chart provides a visualization of every request the page made when
a user executed it. Each line in the chart represents an HTTP network request and
helps you quickly identify what resources are taking the longest to load and in what
order they are loading.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<p>The colored bars within each line indicate the time spent per resource. Each color
represents a different part of that resource&#8217;s loading process and
includes the time spent downloading content for specific Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) types: HTML, JS, CSS, Media, Font, XHR, and Other.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand each phase of a request so you can improve your site&#8217;s
speed by reducing the time spent in each one.</p>

<p>Without leaving the waterfall chart, you can view data points relating to each resource:
resource details, request headers, response headers, and certificate headers. On the
waterfall chart, select a resource name, or any part of each row, to display the
resource details overlay.</p>
<p>For additional analysis, whether to check the content of a CSS file or to view a specific image,
click <span class="image"><img src="images/url-link-icon.png" alt="View page"></span> located beside each resource,
to view its content in a new tab.</p>
<p>You can also navigate between steps and checks at the top of the page to view the
corresponding waterfall charts.</p>
