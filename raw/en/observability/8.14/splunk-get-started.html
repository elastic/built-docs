<p>This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.</p>

<p>Apache, AWS CloudTrail, Nginx, and Zeek integrations offer the ability
to seamlessly ingest data from a Splunk Enterprise instance.  Data
will be automatically mapped to the Elastic Common Schema, making it
available for rapid analysis in Elastic solutions, including Security
and Observability.</p>
<p>These integrations work by using the <code class="literal">httpjson</code> input in Elastic Agent to
run a Splunk search via the Splunk REST API and then extract the raw
event from the results.  The raw event is then processed via the
Elastic Agent.  The Splunk search is customizable and the interval between
searches is customizable.  These integrations only get new data since
the last query, not historical data.</p>

<p>To ingest Nginx data from Splunk, perform the following steps.
The options are the same for Apache, AWS CloudTrail, and Zeek.</p>
<h4><a id="splunk-prereqs"></a>Prerequisites<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.14/docs/en/observability/splunk-get-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>To follow the steps in this guide, you need an Elastic Stack deployment that includes:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Elasticsearch for storing and searching data
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Kibana for visualizing and managing data
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Kibana user with <code class="literal">All</code> privileges on Fleet and Integrations. Since many
Integrations assets are shared across spaces, users need the Kibana privileges
in all spaces.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Integrations Server (included by default in every Elasticsearch Service deployment)
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To get started quickly, spin up a deployment of our hosted Elasticsearch Service. The Elasticsearch Service is
available on AWS, GCP, and Azure. <a href="/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup?page=docs&amp;placement=docs-body" class="ulink" target="_top">Try it out for free</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="splunk-step-one"></a>Step 1: Add integration<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.14/docs/en/observability/splunk-get-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Find the Nginx integration and begin adding it as described in
<a class="xref" href="logs-metrics-get-started.html#add-nginx-integration" title="Step 4: Monitor Nginx logs and metrics">Ingest logs, metrics, and uptime data</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="splunk-step-two"></a>Step 2: Enable Collect logs from third-party REST API<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.14/docs/en/observability/splunk-get-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Enable "Collect logs from third-party REST API" and disable both "Collect
logs from Nginx instances" and "Collect metrics from Nginx instances".</p>

<h4><a id="splunk-step-three"></a>Step 3: Enter connection information<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.14/docs/en/observability/splunk-get-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Enter the required information to connect to the Splunk Enterprise REST API.</p>
<p>The URL of the Splunk Enterprise Server must include the scheme (<code class="literal">http</code> or <code class="literal">https</code>),
the IP address or hostname of the Splunk Enterprise Server, and the port the
REST API is listening on.</p>
<p>The Splunk username and password must be of a user with a role or
capability to use REST API endpoints.  Administrative users have these
permissions by default.</p>
<p>SSL Configuration is available under the "Advanced options".  These may be necessary
if Splunk Enterprise server uses self-signed certificates.  See
<a href="/guide/en/beats/filebeat/8.14/configuration-ssl.html" class="ulink" target="_top">SSL Options</a>
for valid configuration options.</p>

<h4><a id="splunk-step-four"></a>Step 4: Enter information to select data from Splunk<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.14/docs/en/observability/splunk-get-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>For each type of log file, enter the interval and Splunk search string.</p>
<p>The interval is expressed as a
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration" class="ulink" target="_top">Go duration</a>.  The interval
is the time between requests sent to the Splunk Enterprise REST API to
request new information.  Intervals less than one second are not
recommended; Splunk only maintains second accuracy for index time.
The interval should closely match the rate at which data arrives at
the Splunk Enterprise Server.  For example, an interval of "5s" for
data that only arrives at the Splunk Enterprise Server every hour will
generate unnecessary load on the Splunk Enterprise Server.</p>
<p>The search string is the Splunk search used to uniquely describe the
events that match the type of log file you are trying to configure.
For example, to uniquely describe Nginx access logs <code class="literal">search
sourcetype=nginx:plus:access</code> might be used.  Note, the search string
must begin with "search" for details refer to the Splunk REST API
manual and the "search/jobs/export" endpoint.</p>
<p>Be aware that each time the Elastic Agent connects to the Splunk Enterprise
REST API a Splunk search is performed.  Because of this you want to be
sure your search string is as specific as possible, since this reduces
the load on the Splunk Enterprise Server.</p>
<p>Tags may be added in the "Advanced options".  For example, if you&#8217;d
like to tag events coming from Splunk with a <em>Splunk</em> tag, you can add
it here.  By default, the forward tag is present to indicate that
events are being forwarded via an intermediary, i.e. Splunk.</p>

<p>Click Save Integration</p>
<p>Data and Dashboards will be available just as if you had collected
the data on the Nginx host using log files.</p>

<p>The time on the host running the agent and the Splunk Enterprise
Server should be synchronized to the same time source, with correct
timezone information.  Failure to do this could result in delays in
transferring data or gaps in the data received.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Does the Splunk data need to be in a specific format or mapped to
Splunk&#8217;s Common Information Model?</strong></span>  No, because these integrations
take the raw event from Splunk and process that.  There is no
dependency on any Splunk processing.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Are events mapped to Elastic Common Schema (ECS)?</strong></span>  Yes, events from
these integrations go through the exact same processing as if Elastic Agent
had gotten the event from the original source.  So the same level of
mapping to ECS occurs.</p>
