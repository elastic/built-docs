<p>The elastic-serverless-forwarder application enables you to ingest logs from the
AWS environment into Elastic in a completely serverless fashion. You don’t need to
set up and maintain compute resources, which simplifies the getting started
experience and reduces data onboarding friction. The application is publicly
available in the Serverless Application repository (SAR), an AWS-managed repository
for serverless applications.</p>

<p>We started with Amazon S3 in the last release and have now added Kinesis data
streams, CloudWatch logs, and direct SQS queue as additional input options. This
application fits seamlessly into your current operating environment, which means
you don’t need to change any environments to start getting the logs ingested
into Elastic.</p>

<h3><a id="_custom_aws_logs_integration_for_elastic_agent"></a>Custom AWS logs integration for Elastic Agent<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.2/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>We have added a new Custom AWS logs integration for ingesting custom
AWS logs for which we don’t have an out-of-the-box Elastic Agent integration.
This new integration supports both
Amazon S3 and CloudWatch logs as an input source for these logs. You can choose
to set up your own index templates and ingest pipelines, and configure the
integration to write data to a specific data stream. You can then use the power
of Kibana to analyze the collected data.</p>

<p>The new Microsoft Azure VM extension for Elastic Agent provides Azure users a
straightforward way to install and register Elastic Agent on all their Azure VMs.
It automatically installs Elastic Agent, registers it with Fleet, creates a
separate policy that collects system logs and metrics, and assigns this policy
— all with a single checkbox or command line option.</p>
<p>You can use the Elastic deployment pane on the Azure console to configure
the Elastic Azure VM extension with a single click. If you prefer to manage with
scripts, you can use Azure CLI or Powershell to interact with the extension and
get Elastic Agent installed and configured on all your Azure VMs.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">

<p>Then you can manage the lifecycle of your Elastic Agents from within
Fleet. For more information, see the <a href="/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-azure-marketplace-native.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Native Azure integration documentation</a>
and <a href="/guide/en/observability/current/monitor-azure.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Monitor Microsoft Azure tutorial</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="_elastic_agent_support_for_logstash_output_public_beta"></a>Elastic Agent support for Logstash output (public beta)<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.2/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You can now add a Logstash instance as an output to an Elastic Agent policy.
This feature is available as a public beta, with the goal of making it generally
available (GA) in 8.4. Inline instructions are provided to Configure Logstash
for Elastic Agent (as shown below) that step through the requirements to
establish a secure connection between agents and the Logstash instance. Please
note that mutual TLS is enforced when agents are set to write to a Logstash output.</p>

<h3><a id="_apm_support_for_kibana_spaces"></a>APM support for Kibana spaces<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.2/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You can now configure APM UI indices in the context of Kibana spaces. This
enables you to segment APM-related data to leverage Kibana spaces for access
controls and UI performance improvements.</p>

<p>APM Service groups provide a simple way to curate services into groups. Group
services together to build curated inventory views that remove noise and
simplify investigations across services. Groups are Kibana space-specific and
available for any users with appropriate access.</p>
<p>You can create Service groups with a simple KQL-based workflow to populate group
members. Once created, group members can interact with the service inventory and
service map within the group context.</p>
<p>Service groups are introduced as part of a technical preview — to enable Service
groups, navigate to Kibana Stack Management &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Observability,
and enable <span class="strong strong"><strong>Service groups feature</strong></span>.</p>

<h3><a id="_apm_visibility_for_aws_lambda_functions"></a>APM visibility for AWS Lambda Functions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.2/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elastic APM now supports distributed tracing for AWS Lambda Functions running in
production environments. This feature is currently supported by the Java, Python,
and Node.js Agents. It provides performance monitoring, error monitoring, and
topology views showing dependencies within the distributed microservices
architecture. Additionally, auto-instrumentation of traces, transactions, and
spans out-of-the-box are supported.</p>
<p>The APM agent sends traces to the APM Lambda Extension which is responsible for
APM server interactions. The APM agent identifies cold starts of AWS Lambda
functions and collects trigger-specific information for each Lambda invocation,
as well as metadata associated with the AWS Lambda runtime.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the following screenshot, cold starts of lambda invocations
are directly denoted in the trace waterfall view.</p>

<h3><a id="_support_for_compressed_spans_in_elastic_apm"></a>Support for compressed spans in Elastic APM<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.2/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>You can now reduce storage and processing overheads associated with low-value
spans such as those encountered in an N+1 query to a database or cache.
Normally, it would be quite difficult to analyze a trace waterfall in the UI
involving hundreds of short duration spans. This feature enables such spans to
be represented by a single aggregated span. The compressed span also provides
contextual information such as the total number of spans included, total
duration, and average span duration. This feature is currently supported by the
Java, .NET, Python, GO, and PHP Agents.</p>

<h3><a id="_new_dedicated_view_for_observability_alerting_rules"></a>New dedicated view for Observability alerting rules<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.2/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>As part of our ongoing improvements to Observability alerting features
(currently available as a technical preview), you can now manage rules via a
dedicated Observability rule management view available from the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alerts</strong></span> page.
This means you don’t have to leave the Observability context to view
observability-specific alerting rules, making it easier to find and manage
relevant rules. Use search and filter options to quickly identify and select the
rules you want to manage. In addition to the new view, you can now also include
the <span class="strong strong"><strong>alert reason</strong></span> message and <span class="strong strong"><strong>View in app</strong></span> URL as variables within alert
notifications.</p>
