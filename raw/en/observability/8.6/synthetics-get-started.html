<p>To set up a synthetic monitor, you need to configure the monitor, run it, and send data back to Elasticsearch.
After setup is complete, the data will be available in the Uptime app in Kibana to view, analyze, and alert on.</p>
<p><a id="uptime-set-up-choose"></a>There are three ways to set up a synthetic monitor:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">

Heartbeat

<li class="listitem">
Project Monitors

The Uptime app UI
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Read more about each option below, and choose the approach that works best for you.</p>
<h3><a id="choose-heartbeat"></a>Heartbeat<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.6/docs/en/observability/synthetics-get-started.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Heartbeat is a lightweight daemon that you install on a remote server to periodically
check the status of your services and determine if they are available. Performance data is
then gathered and reported back to Heartbeat, where it&#8217;s formatted and sent to the Elastic Stack.</p>
<p>This approach is only recommended for <a class="xref" href="monitor-uptime-synthetics.html#monitoring-uptime" title="Lightweight HTTP/S, TCP, and ICMP monitors">lightweight checks</a>, and
works well for system administrators wanting to configure lightweight
monitors using YAML files. <span class="strong strong"><strong>You should <em>not</em> use this approach to create browser monitors.</strong></span>
If you want to create browser monitors, use <a class="xref" href="synthetics-get-started.html#choose-projects" title="Project Monitors">Project Monitors</a> or the <a class="xref" href="synthetics-get-started.html#choose-ui" title="Uptime app">Uptime app</a> instead.</p>

<p>With Elastic Project Monitors, you write tests in an external version-controlled
project using YAML for lightweight monitors and JavaScript or TypeScript for browser monitors.
Then, you use the <code class="literal">@elastic/synthetics</code> NPM library’s <code class="literal">push</code> command to create
monitors in Kibana.</p>
<p>This approach works well if you want to create both browser monitors and lightweight
monitors. It also allows you to configure and update monitors using a GitOps workflow.

<p>The Uptime app is an application in Kibana.
You can create monitors directly in the Uptime app using the user interface.
To try out this beta functionality, you will need to enable Monitor Management.</p>
<p>This approach works well if you want to configure and update monitors using a
UI in your browser.

<p>The Elastic Synthetics integration is a method for creating
