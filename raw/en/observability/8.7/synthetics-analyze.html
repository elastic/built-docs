<p>The Synthetics app in Kibana both gives you a high-level overview of your service&#8217;s
availability and allows you to dig into details to diagnose what caused downtime.</p>
<h3><a id="synthetics-analyze-overview"></a>Overview<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.7/docs/en/observability/synthetics-analyze.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The Synthetics <span class="strong strong"><strong>Overview</strong></span> tab provides you with a high-level view of all the services you are monitoring
to help you quickly diagnose outages and other connectivity issues within your network.</p>
<p>To access this page, go to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Observability</strong></span> &#8594; <span class="strong strong"><strong>Synthetics</strong></span> and make sure you&#8217;re on the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Overview</strong></span> tab.</p>
<p>This overview includes a snapshot of the current status of all monitors, the number of errors that
occurred over the last 6 hours, and the number of alerts over the last 12 hours.
All monitors created using projects or using the Synthetics app will be listed below with information
about the location, current status, and duration average.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>When you use a single monitor configuration to create monitors in multiple locations, each location
is listed as a separate monitor as they run as individual monitors and the status and duration average
can vary by location.</p>

<p>To get started with your analysis in the Overview tab, you can search for monitors or
use the filter options including current status (up, down, or disabled),
monitor type (for example, journey or HTTP), location, and more.</p>
<p>Then click an individual monitor to see some details in a flyout.
From there, you can click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Go to monitor</strong></span> to go to an individual monitor&#8217;s page
to see more details (as described below).</p>

<p>When you go to an individual monitor&#8217;s page, you&#8217;ll see much more detail about the monitor&#8217;s

<p>The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Overview</strong></span> tab has information about the monitor availability, duration, and any errors
that have occurred since the monitor was created.
The <em>Duration trends</em> chart displays the timing for each check that was performed in the last 30 days.
This visualization helps you to gain insights into how quickly requests resolve by the targeted endpoint
and gives you a sense of how frequently a host or endpoint was down.</p>

<p>The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Timing</strong></span> visualization shows a breakdown of the time spent in each part of

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">

<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Blocked</strong></span>: The request was initiated but is blocked or queued.

</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Connect</strong></span>: The time it took the request to connect to the server.
Lengthy connections could indicate network issues, connection errors, or an overloaded server.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>TLS</strong></span>: If your page is loading resources securely over TLS, this is the time it took to set up that connection.

<p>The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Object weight</strong></span> visualization shows the cumulative size of downloaded resources by type,

<p>This provides a different kind of analysis.
For example, you might have a large number of JavaScript files,

<p>The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Network requests</strong></span> visualization is a waterfall chart that shows every request
the page made when a user executed it.
Each line in the chart represents an HTTP network request and helps you quickly identify
what resources are taking the longest to load and in what order they are loading.</p>
<p>The colored bars within each line indicate the time spent per resource.
Each color represents a different part of that resource&#8217;s loading process
(as defined in the <a class="xref" href="synthetics-analyze.html#synthetics-analyze-one-step-timing" title="Timing">Timing</a> section above) and
includes the time spent downloading content for specific
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) types:
HTML, JS, CSS, Media, Font, XHR, and Other.</p>
<p>Understanding each phase of a request can help you improve your site&#8217;s speed by
reducing the time spent in each phase.</p>

resource details, request headers, response headers, and certificate headers.
On the waterfall chart, select a resource name, or any part of each row,
