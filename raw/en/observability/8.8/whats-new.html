<p>Our front-end synthetic monitoring complements APM and Infrastructure Observability, offering critical visibility into your application&#8217;s workflows and third-party dependencies. Without it, SREs can&#8217;t fully understand an application&#8217;s ecosystem, making it vital for optimal performance and exceptional user experiences.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/" class="ulink" target="_top">Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose</a> is an extract, transform, and load (ETL) streaming data pipeline service that reliably captures, transforms, and delivers streaming data. Users configure data producers to send data to Kinesis Data Firehose and, with <a href="/guide/en/kinesis/master/aws-firehose-setup-guide.html" class="ulink" target="_top">this new GA integration</a>, Kinesis Data Firehose delivers the data to Elastic Cloud in AWS. Elastic appears as a drop-down option when configuring the Kinesis delivery stream in the AWS console UI, and along with pre-filled default values for most configuration settings, this makes it a direct, easy, agentless setup process to send log data to Elastic.</p>

<h3><a id="_apm_server_binary"></a>APM Server binary<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.8/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When the Elastic APM Server Integration was introduced in version 7.16, documentation was updated to state that the standalone APM Server binary was termed “legacy” and would be deprecated in a future release. After careful consideration of learnings and feedback, the APM Server binary (legacy, standalone) will <em>not</em> be deprecated.</p>
<p>Starting with version 8.8, we are returning full support for standalone APM Server binary for self-managed deployments. The documentation has been updated accordingly, completely removing the “legacy” terminology and deprecation notices.  Moving forward, you can choose between two equally supported options:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">

<p>This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 8.8, we are introducing new Service-level objectives (SLOs) management in Elastic Observability, which provides a powerful new way to measure and monitor your service quality over time.</p>
<p>SLOs allow you to set clear, measurable targets for your service performance based on factors like availability, response times, error rates, and other key metrics. You can define SLOs based on different types of data sources like custom KQL queries, APM latency or availability data, and more to come.</p>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/whats-new-slo-create-new.png" alt="whats new slo create new">
</div>
</div>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve defined your SLOs, you can monitor them in real time, with detailed dashboards and alerts that help you quickly identify and troubleshoot issues. You can also track your progress against your SLO targets over time, with a clear view of your error budgets and burn rates.</p>

<p>Support for <a href="https://sre.google/workbook/alerting-on-slos/#6:~:text=6%3A%20Multiwindow%2C%20Multi%2DBurn%2DRate%20Alerts" class="ulink" target="_top">multiwindow burn rate alerting</a> on SLOs, as defined by the Google SRE book, is included. This allows you to get alerted when the burn rate of your SLO is above a defined threshold for two different lookback windows:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
A long window, which you define.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
A shorter window, which is automatically defined as 1/12th of the long window.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For example, if you set the long window to 1 hour, the short window will be set to 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Then for each lookback window, we compute the burn rate as the error rate divided by the error budget. When both burn rates are above the threshold, we trigger an alert.</p>

<p>You can now enhance Observability alert rule definitions with context attributes. For example, alerts can be based on specific variables like transaction types, error groups, host names, or cloud region. This allows for more granular controls on alerting to reduce alert fatigue and make notifications more actionable.</p>

<p>Alert details pages have been added for APM latency alerts. The Alert details page provides the alert history and related information. You can use the alert detail page to gather information necessary to define the impact, urgency, and next steps for resolving an alert. APM latency gets the first alert detail page for triaging alerts, but many more are coming for other Observability alerts in upcoming releases.</p>

</div>
<p>The <a class="xref" href="analyze-hosts.html" title="Analyze and compare hosts on the Hosts page">Hosts</a> feature now allows you to view and filter by metadata (as well as processes) in the new preview fly-out available on each host to make it easier to compare similar hosts:</p>

<p>There is also now a host limit to allow you to run quicker queries by limiting the number of hosts being returned in your query so you don&#8217;t lose focus in your workflow:</p>
