<p>Distributed tracing can generate a substantial amount of data.
More data can mean higher costs and more noise.
Sampling aims to lower the amount of data ingested and the effort required to analyze that data&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all while still making it easy to find anomalous patterns in your applications, detect outages, track errors,
and lower mean time to recovery (MTTR).</p>
<p>Elastic APM supports two types of sampling:</p>

<p>In head-based sampling, the sampling decision for each trace is made when the trace is initiated.
Each trace has a defined and equal probability of being sampled.</p>
<p>For example, a sampling value of <code class="literal">.2</code> indicates a transaction sample rate of <code class="literal">20%</code>.
This means that only <code class="literal">20%</code> of traces will send and retain all of their associated information.
The remaining traces will drop contextual information to reduce the transfer and storage size of the trace.</p>
<p>Head-based sampling is quick and easy to set up.
Its downside is that it&#8217;s entirely random&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;interesting
data might be discarded purely due to chance.</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="apm-sampling.html#apm-configure-head-based-sampling" title="Configure head-based sampling">Configure head-based sampling</a> to get started.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h8><a id="distributed-tracing-examples"></a>Distributed tracing</h8><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/main/docs/en/observability/apm/data-model/transactions/sampling.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>In a distributed trace, the sampling decision is still made when the trace is initiated.
Each subsequent service respects the initial service&#8217;s sampling decision, regardless of its configured sample rate;
the result is a sampling percentage that matches the initiating service.</p>
<p>In the example in <em>Figure 1</em>, <code class="literal">Service A</code> initiates four transactions and has sample rate of <code class="literal">.5</code> (<code class="literal">50%</code>).
The upstream sampling decision is respected, so even if the sample rate is defined and is a different
value in <code class="literal">Service B</code> and <code class="literal">Service C</code>, the sample rate will be <code class="literal">.5</code> (<code class="literal">50%</code>) for all services.</p>

<p>In the example in <em>Figure 2</em>, <code class="literal">Service A</code> initiates four transactions and has a sample rate of <code class="literal">1</code> (<code class="literal">100%</code>).
Again, the upstream sampling decision is respected, so the sample rate for all services will
be <code class="literal">1</code> (<code class="literal">100%</code>).</p>

<p>In addition to setting the sample rate, you can also specify which <em>trace continuation strategy</em> to use.
There are three trace continuation strategies: <code class="literal">continue</code>, <code class="literal">restart</code>, and <code class="literal">restart_external</code>.</p>
<p>The <span class="strong strong"><strong><code class="literal">continue</code></strong></span> trace continuation strategy is the default and will behave similar to the examples in
the <a class="xref" href="apm-sampling.html#distributed-tracing-examples" title="Distributed tracing">Distributed tracing section</a>.</p>
<p>Use the <span class="strong strong"><strong><code class="literal">restart_external</code></strong></span> trace continuation strategy on an Elastic-monitored service to start
a new trace if the previous service did not have a <code class="literal">traceparent</code> header with <code class="literal">es</code> vendor data.
This can be helpful if a transaction includes an Elastic-monitored service that is receiving requests
from an unmonitored service.</p>
<p>In the example in <em>Figure 3</em>, <code class="literal">Service A</code> is an Elastic-monitored service that initiates four transactions
with a sample rate of <code class="literal">.25</code> (<code class="literal">25%</code>). Because <code class="literal">Service B</code> is unmonitored, the traces started in
<code class="literal">Service A</code> will end there. <code class="literal">Service C</code> is an Elastic-monitored service that initiates four transactions
that start new traces with a new sample rate of <code class="literal">.5</code> (<code class="literal">50%</code>). Because <code class="literal">Service D</code> is also
Elastic-monitored service, the upstream sampling decision defined in <code class="literal">Service C</code> is respected.
The end result will be three sampled traces.</p>

</div>
<p>Use the <span class="strong strong"><strong><code class="literal">restart</code></strong></span> trace continuation strategy on an Elastic-monitored service to start
a new trace regardless of whether the previous service had a <code class="literal">traceparent</code> header.
This can be helpful if an Elastic-monitored service is publicly exposed, and you do not
want tracing data to possibly be spoofed by user requests.</p>
<p>In the example in <em>Figure 4</em>, <code class="literal">Service A</code> and <code class="literal">Service B</code> are Elastic-monitored services that use the
default trace continuation strategy. <code class="literal">Service A</code> has a sample rate of <code class="literal">.25</code> (<code class="literal">25%</code>), and that
sampling decision is respected in <code class="literal">Service B</code>. <code class="literal">Service C</code> is an Elastic-monitored service that
uses the <code class="literal">restart</code> trace continuation strategy and has a sample rate of <code class="literal">1</code> (<code class="literal">100%</code>).
Because it uses <code class="literal">restart</code>, the upstream sample rate is <em>not</em> respected in <code class="literal">Service C</code> and all four
traces will be sampled as new traces in <code class="literal">Service C</code>. The end result will be five sampled traces.</p>

<p>Head-based sampling is implemented directly in the APM agents and SDKs.
The sample rate must be propagated between services and the managed intake service in order to produce accurate metrics.</p>
<p>OpenTelemetry offers multiple samplers. However, most samplers do not propagate the sample rate.
This results in inaccurate span-based metrics, like APM throughput, latency, and error metrics.</p>
<p>For accurate span-based metrics when using head-based sampling with OpenTelemetry, you must use
a <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/tracestate-probability-sampling/" class="ulink" target="_top">consistent probability sampler</a>.
These samplers propagate the sample rate between services and the managed intake service, resulting in accurate metrics.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>OpenTelemetry does not offer consistent probability samplers in all languages.
OpenTelemetry users should consider using tail-based sampling instead.</p>

<p>Tail-based sampling is only supported when writing to Elasticsearch.
If you are using a different <a class="xref" href="apm-configuring-output.html" title="Configure the output">output</a>, tail-based sampling is <em>not</em> supported.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In tail-based sampling, the sampling decision for each trace is made after the trace has completed.
This means all traces will be analyzed against a set of rules, or policies, which will determine the rate at which they are sampled.</p>
<p>Unlike head-based sampling, each trace does not have an equal probability of being sampled.
Because slower traces are more interesting than faster ones, tail-based sampling uses weighted random sampling&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;so
traces with a longer root transaction duration are more likely to be sampled than traces with a fast root transaction duration.</p>
<p>A downside of tail-based sampling is that it results in more data being sent from APM agents to the APM Server.
The APM Server will therefore use more CPU, memory, and disk than with head-based sampling.
However, because the tail-based sampling decision happens in APM Server, there is less data to transfer from APM Server to Elasticsearch.
So running APM Server close to your instrumented services can reduce any increase in transfer costs that tail-based sampling brings.</p>

<p>With tail-based sampling, all traces are observed and a sampling decision is only made once a trace completes.</p>
<p>In this example, <code class="literal">Service A</code> initiates four transactions.
If our sample rate is <code class="literal">.5</code> (<code class="literal">50%</code>) for traces with a <code class="literal">success</code> outcome,
and <code class="literal">1</code> (<code class="literal">100%</code>) for traces with a <code class="literal">failure</code> outcome,
the sampled traces would look something like this:</p>

<p>Tail-based sampling is implemented entirely in APM Server,
and will work with traces sent by either Elastic APM agents or OpenTelemetry SDKs.</p>
<p>Due to <a class="xref" href="apm-open-telemetry-known-limitations.html#apm-open-telemetry-tbs" title="OpenTelemetry&#8217;s tail-based sampling">OpenTelemetry tail-based sampling limitations</a> when using <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/tailsamplingprocessor" class="ulink" target="_top">tailsamplingprocessor</a>, we recommend using APM Server tail-based sampling instead.</p>

<p>A sampled trace retains all data associated with it.
A non-sampled trace drops all <a class="xref" href="apm-data-model-spans.html" title="Spans">span</a> and <a class="xref" href="apm-data-model-transactions.html" title="Transactions">transaction</a> data<sup>1</sup>.
Regardless of the sampling decision, all traces retain <a class="xref" href="apm-data-model-errors.html" title="Errors">error</a> data.</p>
<p>Some visualizations in the APM app, like latency, are powered by aggregated transaction and span <a class="xref" href="apm-data-model-metrics.html" title="Metrics">metrics</a>.
The way these metrics are calculated depends on the sampling method used:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Head-based sampling</strong></span>: Metrics are calculated based on all sampled events.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Tail-based sampling</strong></span>: Metrics are calculated based on all events, regardless of whether they are ultimately sampled or not.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Both head and tail-based sampling</strong></span>: When both methods are used together, metrics are calculated based on all events that were sampled by the head-based sampling policy.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For all sampling methods, metrics are weighted by the inverse sampling rate of the head-based sampling policy to provide an estimate of the total population.
For example, if your head-based sampling rate is 5%, each sampled trace is counted as 20.
As the variance of latency increases or the head-based sampling rate decreases, the level of error in these calculations may increase.</p>
<p>These calculation methods ensure that the APM app provides the most accurate metrics possible given the sampling strategy in use, while also accounting for the head-based sampling rate to estimate the full population of traces.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Real User Monitoring (RUM) traces are an exception to this rule.
The Kibana apps that utilize RUM data depend on transaction events,
so non-sampled RUM traces retain transaction data&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;only span data is dropped.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h7><a id="_sample_rates"></a>Sample rates</h7><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/main/docs/en/observability/apm/data-model/transactions/sampling.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>What&#8217;s the best sampling rate? Unfortunately, there isn&#8217;t one.
Sampling is dependent on your data, the throughput of your application, data retention policies, and other factors.
A sampling rate from <code class="literal">.1%</code> to <code class="literal">100%</code> would all be considered normal.
You&#8217;ll likely decide on a unique sample rate for different scenarios.
Here are some examples:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Services with considerably more traffic than others might be safe to sample at lower rates
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Routes that are more important than others might be sampled at higher rates
</li>
<li class="listitem">
A production service environment might warrant a higher sampling rate than a development environment
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Failed trace outcomes might be more interesting than successful traces&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;thus requiring a higher sample rate
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Regardless of the above, cost conscious customers are likely to be fine with a lower sample rate.</p>

<p>There are three ways to adjust the head-based sampling rate of your APM agents:</p>

<p>The transaction sample rate can be changed dynamically (no redeployment necessary) on a per-service and per-environment
basis with <a class="xref" href="apm-agent-configuration.html" title="APM agent central configuration">APM agent Configuration</a> in Kibana.</p>

<p>APM agent configuration exposes an API that can be used to programmatically change
your agents' sampling rate.
An example is provided in the <a class="xref" href="apm-agent-config-api.html" title="Agent Configuration API">Agent configuration API reference</a>.</p>

<p>Each agent provides a configuration value used to set the transaction sample rate.

When enabled, trace events are mapped to sampling policies.
Each sampling policy must specify a sample rate, and can optionally specify other conditions.
All of the policy conditions must be true for a trace event to match it.</p>
<p>Trace events are matched to policies in the order specified.
Each policy list must conclude with a default policy&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;one that only specifies a sample rate.
This default policy is used to catch remaining trace events that don&#8217;t match a stricter policy.
Requiring this default policy ensures that traces are only dropped intentionally.
If you enable tail-based sampling and send a transaction that does not match any of the policies,
APM Server will reject the transaction with the error <code class="literal">no matching policy</code>.</p>

<p>Criteria used to match a root transaction to a sample rate.</p>
<p>Policies map trace events to a sample rate.
Each policy must specify a sample rate.
Trace events are matched to policies in the order specified.
All policy conditions must be true for a trace event to match.
Each policy list should conclude with a policy that only specifies a sample rate.
This final policy is used to catch remaining trace events that don&#8217;t match a stricter policy.

<p>The amount of storage space allocated for trace events matching tail sampling policies. Caution: Setting this limit higher than the allowed space may cause APM Server to become unhealthy.</p>
<p>If the configured storage limit is insufficient, it logs "configured storage limit reached". The event will bypass sampling and will always be indexed when storage limit is reached.</p>

<p>The sample rate to apply to trace events matching this policy.
Required in each policy.</p>
<p>The sample rate must be greater than or equal to <code class="literal">0</code> and less than or equal to <code class="literal">1</code>.
For example, a <code class="literal">sample_rate</code> of <code class="literal">0.01</code> means that 1% of trace events matching the policy will be sampled.
A <code class="literal">sample_rate</code> of <code class="literal">1</code> means that 100% of trace events matching the policy will be sampled. (int)</p>

<p>The trace name for events to match a policy.
A match occurs when the configured <code class="literal">trace.name</code> matches the <code class="literal">transaction.name</code> of the root transaction of a trace.
A root transaction is any transaction without a <code class="literal">parent.id</code>. (string)</p>
