<p>To monitor resources on private networks you can either:</p>

<ul class="itemizedlist">

Allow Elastic&#8217;s global managed infrastructure to access your private endpoints.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Use Elastic Agent to create a Private Location.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Private Locations via Elastic Agent require only outbound connections from your network,
while allowing Elastic&#8217;s global managed infrastructure to access a private endpoint requires
inbound access, thus posing an additional risk that users must assess.</p>
<h3><a id="monitor-via-access-control"></a>Allow access to your private network<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/main/docs/en/observability/synthetics-private-location.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>To give Elastic&#8217;s global managed infrastructure access to a private endpoint, use IP address filtering, HTTP authentication, or both.</p>
<p>To grant access via IP, use <a href="https://manifest.synthetics.elastic-cloud.com/v1/ip-ranges.json" class="ulink" target="_top">this list of egress IPs</a>.
The addresses and locations on this list may change, so automating updates to
filtering rules is recommended. IP filtering alone will allow all users of Elastic&#8217;s global managed infrastructure access to your endpoints, if this
is a concern consider adding additional protection via user/password authentication via a proxy like nginx.</p>

<p>Start by setting up Fleet Server and Elastic Agent:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Set up Fleet Server</strong></span>: If you are using Elastic Cloud, Fleet Server will already be provided and you can skip this step.
To learn more, refer to <a href="/guide/en/fleet/master/fleet-server.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Set up Fleet Server</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Create an agent policy</strong></span>: For more information on agent policies and creating them,
refer to <a href="/guide/en/fleet/master/agent-policy.html#create-a-policy" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Agent policy</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>A Private Location should be set up against an agent policy that runs on a single Elastic Agent.
The Elastic Agent must be <span class="strong strong"><strong>enrolled in Fleet</strong></span> (Private Locations cannot be set up using <span class="strong strong"><strong>standalone</strong></span> Elastic Agents).
Do <em>not</em> run the same agent policy on multiple agents being used for Private Locations, as you may
end up with duplicate or missing tests. Private Locations do not currently load balance tests across
multiple Elastic Agents. See <a class="xref" href="synthetics-private-location.html#synthetics-private-location-scaling" title="Scaling Private Locations">Scaling Private Locations</a> for information on increasing the capacity
within a Private Location.</p>
<p>By default Private Locations are configured to allow two simultaneous browser tests and an unlimited number of lightweight checks.
As a result, if more than two browser tests are assigned to a particular Private Location, there may be a delay to run them.</p>

<p>After setting up Fleet, you&#8217;ll connect Fleet to the Elastic Stack
and enroll an Elastic Agent in Fleet.</p>
<p><a id="synthetics-private-location-docker"></a>Elastic provides Docker images that you can use to run Fleet and an Elastic Agent more easily.
For monitors running on Private Locations, you <em>must</em> use the <code class="literal">elastic-agent-complete</code>
Docker image to create a self-hosted Elastic Agent node. The standard Elastic Cloud or self-hosted
Elastic Agent will not work.</p>
<p>Version 8.16.0 has not yet been released.</p>
<p>Then enroll and run an Elastic Agent.
You&#8217;ll need an enrollment token and the URL of the Fleet Server.
You can use the default enrollment token for your policy or create new policies
and <a href="/guide/en/fleet/master/fleet-enrollment-tokens.html" class="ulink" target="_top">enrollment tokens</a> as needed.</p>
<p>For more information on running Elastic Agent with Docker, refer to
<a href="/guide/en/fleet/master/elastic-agent-container.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Run Elastic Agent in a container</a>.</p>

<p>It is not currently possible to use custom CAs for synthetics browser tests in private locations without following a workaround. To learn more about the workaround, refer to the following GitHub issue: <a href="https://github.com/elastic/synthetics/issues/717" class="ulink" target="_top">elastic/synthetics#717</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="synthetics-private-location-scaling"></a>Scaling Private Locations<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/main/docs/en/observability/synthetics-private-location.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>By default Private Locations are configured to allow two simultaneous browser tests, and an unlimited number of lightweight checks.
These limits can be set via the environment variables <code class="literal">SYNTHETICS_LIMIT_{TYPE}</code>, where <code class="literal">{TYPE}</code> is one of <code class="literal">BROWSER</code>, <code class="literal">HTTP</code>, <code class="literal">TCP</code>, and <code class="literal">ICMP</code>
for the container running the Elastic Agent docker image.</p>
<p>It is critical to allocate enough memory and CPU capacity to handle configured limits.
Start by allocating at least 2 GiB of memory and two cores per browser instance to ensure consistent
performance and avoid out-of-memory errors. Then adjust as needed. Resource requirements will vary depending on workload.
Much less memory is needed for lightweight monitors. Start by allocating at least 512MiB of memory and two cores for
lightweight checks. Then increase allocated memory and CPU based on observed usage patterns.</p>
<p>These limits are for simultaneous tests, not total tests. For example, if
60 browser tests were scheduled to run once per hour and each took 1 minute to run, that would fully occupy one execution slot.
However, it is a good practice to set up execution slots with extra capacity. A good starting point would be to over-allocate by
a factor of 5. In the previous example that would mean allocating 5 slots.</p>
