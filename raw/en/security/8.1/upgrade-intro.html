<p>We highly recommend that all Elastic Security users keep their deployments up to date with the latest available Elastic Stack version to access new features, security updates, and performance enhancements. This topic describes updates in 8.0 that require changes to your agents, existing data, user privileges, or system preferences.</p>
<p>For upgrading to the latest Elastic Stack version, we recommend using the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.1/upgrade-assistant.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana Upgrade Assistant</a>.</p>

<p>Upgrade your Elastic Stack and Elastic Agents to 7.17 first (refer to <a href="/guide/en/fleet/8.1/upgrade-elastic-agent.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrade Fleet-managed Elastic Agents</a>). Afterwards, you can <a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack/8.1/upgrading-elastic-stack.html" class="ulink" target="_top">upgrade the Elastic Stack</a> to 8.x. Initially, Elastic Agents will be version 7.17; this is fine because Elastic Security 8.x supports the last minor release in 7.x (7.17) and any subsequent Elastic Endpoint versions in 8.x. After the Elastic Stack upgrade, you can decide whether to upgrade Elastic Agents to 8.0, which is recommended to ensure you get the latest features.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re upgrading to Elastic Stack 8.0.x or 8.1.x, you must update your Elastic prebuilt detection rules <em>while your Elastic Stack is at 7.17</em>. To update Elastic prebuilt rules, go to the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Rules</strong></span> page and select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Update <em>x</em> Elastic prebuilt rules</strong></span>. This ensures that you have the latest prebuilt rules before upgrading the Elastic Stack.</p>
<p>This step isn&#8217;t required if you&#8217;re upgrading to Elastic Stack 8.2 or later. If you&#8217;re unable to update your prebuilt rules at 7.17, upgrade to Elastic Stack 8.2 or later.</p>

<p>Upon upgrading to 8.0, rules are automatically disabled. Once the upgrade completes, you should re-enable them again to avoid gaps in rule coverage. <em>We highly recommend that you track your active rules before upgrading so you can easily find and re-enable them after upgrading to 8.0</em>.</p>

<p>When you manually install Elastic Endpoint, you must approve a system extension, kernel extension, and enable Full Disk Access (FDA). There is a new FDA requirement in 8.0.

<p>The system index for detection alerts has been renamed from <code class="literal">.siem-signals-&lt;space-id&gt;</code> to <code class="literal">.alerts-security.alerts-&lt;space-id&gt;</code> and is now a hidden index.

<p>Changes to the indicator match rule&#8217;s <a class="xref" href="rules-ui-create.html#rule-ui-advanced-params" title="Configure advanced rule settings (optional)">default threat indicator path</a> might require you to update existing rules, or create new ones, after upgrading to 8.0.

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
If an indicator match rule&#8217;s default threat indicator path was not defined before the upgrade, it will default to <code class="literal">threatintel.indicator</code> after the upgrade. This allows the rule to continue using indicator data ingested by Filebeat version 7.x. If a custom value was defined before the upgrade, the value will not change.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If an existing indicator match rule was configured to use threat indicator indices generated from Filebeat version 7.x, updating the default threat indicator path to <code class="literal">threat.indicator</code> after you upgrade to Elastic Stack version 8.0 and Elastic Agent or Filebeat version 8.0 configures the rule to use threat indicator indices generated by those later versions.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
You must create separate rules to query threat intelligence indices created by Filebeat version 7.x and version 8.0 because each version requires a different default threat indicator path value.

After that point, you can still manually download and install updated prebuilt rules, but you must upgrade to the latest Elastic Security version to receive automatic updates.</p>
