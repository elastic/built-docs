<p>Upgrading provides you access to Elastic Security&#8217;s latest features, enhancements, and bug fixes, many of which enable you to save your organization money, respond faster to potential threats, and improve the tools you use to investigate and analyze your data. For more benefits, check out our blog, <a href="/blog/top-5-reasons-to-upgrade-elastic-security" class="ulink" target="_top">Top 5 reasons to upgrade Elastic Security</a>. Also, it&#8217;s important to ensure that your deployment is fully maintained and supported.

<p>Before upgrading to Elastic Security 8.x, consider the following recommendations:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Plan for an appropriate amount of time to complete the upgrade. Depending on your configuration and the size of your cluster, the process can take up to a week to complete.

</li>
<li class="listitem">
Choose a version to upgrade to. We recommend the latest minor and patch version. Be sure to upgrade your development or non-production deployment to the same version as your production deployment.

Ensure that you have <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.10/xpack-monitoring.html" class="ulink" target="_top">stack monitoring</a> enabled in Kibana. Take note of your current index and search rate.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Review your selected version&#8217;s features, Elastic connectors, integrations, and detection rules to determine if you can replace any customized content with out-of-the-box functionality. This can help reduce your workload and the complexity of your upgrade.
</li>
<li class="listitem">

<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="reenable-rules-upgrade"></a>Re-enable disabled rules</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/security-docs/edit/8.10/docs/upgrade/upgrade-7.17-8.x.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Any active rules when you upgrade from 7.17 to 8.0.1 or newer are automatically disabled, and a tag named <code class="literal">auto_disabled_8.0</code> is added to those rules for tracking purposes. Once the upgrade is complete, you can filter rules by the new tag, then use bulk actions to re-enable them:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Go to the Rules page (<span class="strong strong"><strong>Detect &#8594; Rules</strong></span>).

<p>When you manually install Elastic Endpoint, you must approve a system extension, kernel extension, and enable Full Disk Access (FDA). There is a new FDA requirement in 8.x.

<p>To make the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Data view</strong></span> option appear in an environment with legacy alerts, a user with elevated role privileges must visit the Elastic Security app, open a page that displays alert data (at least one alert must be present), and then refresh the page.

<p>The system index for detection alerts has been renamed from <code class="literal">.siem-signals-&lt;space-id&gt;</code> to <code class="literal">.alerts-security.alerts-&lt;space-id&gt;</code> and is now a hidden index.

<p>Changes to the indicator match rule type&#8217;s <a class="xref" href="rules-ui-create.html#rule-ui-advanced-params" title="Configure advanced rule settings (optional)">default threat indicator path</a> might require you to update existing rules or create new ones after upgrading to 8.x.

If an indicator match rule&#8217;s default threat indicator path was not defined before the upgrade, it will default to <code class="literal">threatintel.indicator</code> after the upgrade.

If an existing indicator match rule was configured to use threat indicator indices generated from Filebeat version 7.x, updating the default threat indicator path to <code class="literal">threat.indicator</code> after you upgrade to Elastic Stack version 8.x and Elastic Agent or Filebeat version 8.x configures the rule to use threat indicator indices generated by those later versions.

<li class="listitem">
You must create separate rules to query threat intelligence indices created by Filebeat version 7.x and version 8.x because each version requires a different default threat indicator path value.
