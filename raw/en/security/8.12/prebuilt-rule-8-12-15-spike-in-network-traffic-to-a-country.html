<p>A machine learning job detected an unusually large spike in network activity to one destination country in the network logs. This could be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic. Data exfiltration activity may also produce such a surge in traffic to a destination country that does not normally appear in network traffic or business workflows. Malware instances and persistence mechanisms may communicate with command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in their country of origin, which may be an unusual destination country for the source network.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Triage and analysis</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating Spike in Network Traffic To a Country</strong></span></p>
<p>Monitoring network traffic for anomalies is a good methodology for uncovering various potentially suspicious activities. For example, data exfiltration or infected machines may communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server in another country your company doesn&#8217;t have business with.</p>
<p>This rule uses a machine learning job to detect a significant spike in the network traffic to a country, which can indicate reconnaissance or enumeration activities, an infected machine being used as a bot in a DDoS attack, or potentially data exfiltration.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>This rule requires the installation of associated Machine Learning jobs, as well as data coming in from one of the following integrations:
- Elastic Defend
- Network Packet Capture</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Detection Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Once the rule is enabled, the associated Machine Learning job will start automatically. You can view the Machine Learning job linked under the "Definition" panel of the detection rule. If the job does not start due to an error, the issue must be resolved for the job to commence successfully. For more details on setting up anomaly detection jobs, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-ml-anomalies.html" class="ulink" target="_top">helper guide</a>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Defend Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Elastic Defend is integrated into the Elastic Agent using Fleet. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Prerequisite Requirements:</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Fleet is required for Elastic Defend.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To configure Fleet Server refer to the <a href="/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html" class="ulink" target="_top">documentation</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>The following steps should be executed in order to add the Elastic Defend integration to your system:</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Go to the Kibana home page and click "Add integrations".
</li>

</li>
<li class="listitem">
Select the type of environment you want to protect, either "Traditional Endpoints" or "Cloud Workloads".
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Select a configuration preset. Each preset comes with different default settings for Elastic Agent, you can further customize these later by configuring the Elastic Defend integration policy. <a href="/guide/en/security/current/configure-endpoint-integration-policy.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Helper guide</a>.
</li>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Network Packet Capture Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>The Network Packet Capture integration sniffs network packets on a host and dissects known protocols. Monitoring the network traffic is critical to gaining observability and securing your environment — ensuring high levels of performance and security. The Network Packet Capture integration captures the network traffic between your application servers, decodes common application layer protocols and records the interesting fields for each transaction.</p>
