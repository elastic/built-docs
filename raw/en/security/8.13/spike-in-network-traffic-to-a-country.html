<p>A machine learning job detected an unusually large spike in network activity to one destination country in the network logs. This could be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic. Data exfiltration activity may also produce such a surge in traffic to a destination country that does not normally appear in network traffic or business workflows. Malware instances and persistence mechanisms may communicate with command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in their country of origin, which may be an unusual destination country for the source network.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Triage and analysis</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating Spike in Network Traffic To a Country</strong></span></p>
<p>Monitoring network traffic for anomalies is a good methodology for uncovering various potentially suspicious activities. For example, data exfiltration or infected machines may communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server in another country your company doesn&#8217;t have business with.</p>
<p>This rule uses a machine learning job to detect a significant spike in the network traffic to a country, which can indicate reconnaissance or enumeration activities, an infected machine being used as a bot in a DDoS attack, or potentially data exfiltration.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Identify the specifics of the involved assets, such as role, criticality, and associated users.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate other alerts associated with the involved assets during the past 48 hours.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Examine the data available and determine the exact users and processes involved in those connections.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree) for unknown processes. Examine their executable files for prevalence, whether they are located in expected locations, and if they are signed with valid digital signatures.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Consider the time of day. If the user is a human (not a program or script), did the activity occurs during working hours?
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If this activity is suspicious, contact the account owner and confirm whether they are aware of it.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">

Understand the context of the connections by contacting the asset owners. If this activity is related to a new business process or newly implemented (approved) technology, consider adding exceptions — preferably with a combination of user and source conditions.

Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.

Consider implementing temporary network border rules to block or alert connections to the target country, if relevant.

Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.

Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.

Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.

Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).
