<p>Rolling upgrades are unsupported in Elastic Security, which runs within the Kibana application. To upgrade, you must shut down all Kibana instances, install the new software, and restart Kibana.
Upgrading while older Kibana instances are running can cause data loss or upgrade failures.</p>

<p>When upgrading several Kibana instances connected to the same Elasticsearch cluster,
ensure that all outdated instances are shut down before starting the upgrade.</p>
<p>Rolling upgrades are unsupported in Kibana. However, when outdated instances are shut down, you can start all upgraded instances in parallel,
which allows all instances to participate in the upgrade migration in parallel.</p>
<p>For large deployments with more than 10 Kibana instances and more than 10,000 saved objects,
you can reduce the upgrade downtime by bringing up a single Kibana instance and waiting for it to
complete the upgrade migration before bringing up the remaining instances.</p>

<p>Take these extra steps to ensure you are ready for migration.</p>
<h4><a id="_ensure_your_elasticsearch_cluster_is_healthy"></a>Ensure your Elasticsearch cluster is healthy<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/security-docs/edit/8.13/docs/upgrade/upgrade-security.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Problems with your Elasticsearch cluster can prevent Kibana upgrades from succeeding.</p>
<p>During the upgrade process, Kibana creates new indices into which updated documents are written. If a cluster is approaching the low watermark, there&#8217;s a high risk of Kibana not being able to create these. Reading, transforming, and writing updated documents can be memory intensive, using more available heap than during routine operation. You must ensure that enough heap is available to prevent requests from timing out or throwing errors from circuit breaker exceptions. You should also ensure that all shards are replicated and assigned.</p>
<p>A healthy cluster has:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Enough free disk space, at least twice the amount of storage taken up by the <code class="literal">.kibana</code> and <code class="literal">.kibana_task_manager</code> indices

<p>When you perform an upgrade migration of different Kibana versions, the migration can fail.
Ensure that all Kibana instances are running the same version, configuration, and plugins.</p>

<p>Be sure to have a <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.13/snapshot-restore.html" class="ulink" target="_top">snapshot</a> of all your data before migrating, so that if something goes wrong during migration, you can restore from the snapshot and try again.</p>

<p>Any active rules when you upgrade from 7.17 to 8.0.1 or newer are automatically disabled, and a tag named <code class="literal">auto_disabled_8.0</code> is added to those rules for tracking purposes.

<p>When you manually install Elastic Endpoint, you must approve a system extension, kernel extension, and enable Full Disk Access (FDA). There is a new FDA requirement in 8.x.

<p>To make the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Data view</strong></span> option appear in an environment with legacy alerts, a user with elevated role privileges must visit the Elastic Security app, open a page that displays alert data (such as the Overview page), then refresh the page. The user&#8217;s role privileges must allow them to enable the detections feature in a Kibana space.

<div class="note admon">

<p>Changes to the indicator match rule&#8217;s <a class="xref" href="rules-ui-create.html#rule-ui-advanced-params" title="Configure advanced rule settings (optional)">default threat indicator path</a> might require you to update existing rules or create new ones after upgrading to 8.x.

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
If an indicator match rule&#8217;s default threat indicator path was not defined before the upgrade, it will default to <code class="literal">threatintel.indicator</code> after the upgrade.

If an existing indicator match rule was configured to use threat indicator indices generated from Filebeat version 7.x, updating the default threat indicator path to <code class="literal">threat.indicator</code> after you upgrade to Elastic Stack version 8.x and Elastic Agent or Filebeat version 8.x configures the rule to use threat indicator indices generated by those later versions.

You must create separate rules to query threat intelligence indices created by Filebeat version 7.x and version 8.x because each version requires a different default threat indicator path value.

<p>To upgrade from 7.16.0 or earlier to 8.13.0, you must first upgrade your Elastic Stack and Elastic Agents to 7.17 (refer to <a href="/guide/en/fleet/8.13/upgrade-elastic-agent.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrade Fleet-managed Elastic Agents</a>). This enables you to use the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.13/upgrade-assistant.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrade Assistant</a> to prepare for the upgrade. Before you upgrade, you must resolve all critical issues identified by the Upgrade Assistant. Afterwards, you can <a class="xref" href="upgrade-intro.html#upgrade-7.17-8x" title="Upgrade from 7.17 to an 8.x version">upgrade to 8.x</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, Elastic Agents will be version 7.17. This is fine because Elastic Security 8.x supports the last minor release in 7.x (7.17) and any subsequent Elastic Endpoint versions in 8.x. After the Elastic Stack upgrade, you can decide whether to upgrade Elastic Agents to 8.x, which is recommended to ensure you get the latest features.</p>
