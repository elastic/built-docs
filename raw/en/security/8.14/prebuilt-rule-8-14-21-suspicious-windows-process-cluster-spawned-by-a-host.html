<p>A machine learning job combination has detected a set of one or more suspicious Windows processes with unusually high scores for malicious probability. These process(es) have been classified as malicious in several ways. The process(es) were predicted to be malicious by the ProblemChild supervised ML model. If the anomaly contains a cluster of suspicious processes, each process has the same host name, and the aggregate score of the event cluster was calculated to be unusually high by an unsupervised ML model. Such a cluster often contains suspicious or malicious activity, possibly involving LOLbins, that may be resistant to detection using conventional search rules.</p>

<p>The detection leverages machine learning to identify clusters of Windows processes with high malicious probability scores. Adversaries exploit legitimate tools, known as LOLbins, to evade detection. This rule uses both supervised and unsupervised ML models to flag unusual process clusters on a single host, indicating potential masquerading tactics for defense evasion.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review the host name associated with the suspicious process cluster to determine if it is a critical asset or has a history of similar alerts.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Examine the specific processes flagged by the ProblemChild supervised ML model to identify any known LOLbins or unusual command-line arguments that may indicate masquerading.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check the timeline of the process execution to see if it coincides with any known scheduled tasks or user activity that could explain the anomaly.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate the parent-child relationship of the processes to identify any unexpected or unauthorized process spawning patterns.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Correlate the alert with other security events or logs from the same host to identify any additional indicators of compromise or related suspicious activity.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Assess the network activity associated with the host during the time of the alert to detect any potential data exfiltration or communication with known malicious IP addresses.

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>False positive analysis</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Legitimate administrative tools like PowerShell or Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) may be flagged as suspicious due to their dual-use nature. Users can create exceptions for these tools when used by trusted administrators or during scheduled maintenance.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Automated scripts or scheduled tasks that perform routine system checks or updates might trigger alerts. Review these processes and whitelist them if they are verified as part of regular operations.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Software updates or installations that involve multiple processes spawning in a short time frame can be mistaken for malicious clusters. Ensure that these activities are documented and create exceptions for known update processes.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Development or testing environments where new or experimental software is frequently executed may generate false positives. Consider excluding these environments from monitoring or adjusting the sensitivity of the rule for these specific hosts.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Frequent use of remote desktop or remote management tools by IT staff can appear suspicious. Implement user-based exceptions for known IT personnel to reduce unnecessary alerts.

<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Isolate the affected host immediately to prevent further spread of potential malicious activity. Disconnect it from the network to contain the threat.

Terminate the suspicious processes identified by the alert. Use task management tools or scripts to ensure all instances of the processes are stopped.

Conduct a thorough review of the host&#8217;s system logs and process history to identify any additional indicators of compromise or related malicious activity.

Restore the host from a known good backup if available, ensuring that the backup is free from any signs of compromise.
