<p>A machine learning job detected an unusually large spike in network traffic. Such a burst of traffic, if not caused by a surge in business activity, can be due to suspicious or malicious activity. Large-scale data exfiltration may produce a burst of network traffic; this could also be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic. Denial-of-service attacks or traffic floods may also produce such a surge in traffic.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating Spike in Network Traffic</strong></span></p>
<p>Machine learning models analyze network traffic patterns to identify anomalies, such as unexpected spikes. These spikes may indicate malicious activities like data exfiltration or denial-of-service attacks. Adversaries exploit network vulnerabilities to flood traffic or extract data. The <em>Spike in Network Traffic</em> rule leverages ML to flag unusual traffic surges, aiding in early threat detection and response.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review the timestamp and duration of the traffic spike to determine if it correlates with any scheduled business activities or known events.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Analyze the source and destination IP addresses involved in the traffic spike to identify any unfamiliar or suspicious entities.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Examine the types of network protocols and services involved in the spike to assess if they align with typical network usage patterns.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check for any recent changes in network configurations or security policies that might explain the unusual traffic patterns.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate any associated user accounts or devices to determine if they have been compromised or are exhibiting unusual behavior.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Cross-reference the spike with other security alerts or logs to identify potential patterns or related incidents.

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Business-related traffic surges: Regular spikes due to legitimate business activities, such as marketing campaigns or software updates, can trigger false positives. Users should analyze historical traffic patterns and create exceptions for known business events.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Scheduled data backups: Routine data backups can cause significant network traffic. Users can exclude these by identifying backup schedules and configuring the rule to ignore traffic during these times.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Software updates and patches: Large-scale updates from software vendors can lead to temporary traffic spikes. Users should maintain a list of update schedules and whitelist these events to prevent false alerts.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Internal network scans: Regular security scans or inventory checks within the organization may cause traffic spikes. Users should document these activities and adjust the rule to recognize them as non-threatening.

Cloud service synchronization: Synchronization activities with cloud services can generate high traffic volumes. Users should identify and exclude these regular sync patterns to reduce false positives.

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>This rule requires the installation of associated Machine Learning jobs, as well as data coming in from one of the following integrations:
- Elastic Defend
- Network Packet Capture</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Detection Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Once the rule is enabled, the associated Machine Learning job will start automatically. You can view the Machine Learning job linked under the "Definition" panel of the detection rule. If the job does not start due to an error, the issue must be resolved for the job to commence successfully. For more details on setting up anomaly detection jobs, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-ml-anomalies.html" class="ulink" target="_top">helper guide</a>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Defend Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Elastic Defend is integrated into the Elastic Agent using Fleet. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.</p>
