<p>Looks for commands related to system network configuration discovery from an unusual user context. This can be due to uncommon troubleshooting activity or due to a compromised account. A compromised account may be used by a threat actor to engage in system network configuration discovery in order to increase their understanding of connected networks and hosts. This information may be used to shape follow-up behaviors such as lateral movement or additional discovery.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating Unusual Linux Network Configuration Discovery</strong></span></p>
<p>In Linux environments, network configuration tools are essential for managing and troubleshooting network settings. Adversaries may exploit these tools to gather network details, aiding in lateral movement or further reconnaissance. The detection rule leverages machine learning to identify atypical usage patterns of network commands by unexpected users, signaling potential account compromise or unauthorized network probing.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review the alert details to identify the specific network configuration commands executed and the user account involved. Focus on commands that are typically used for network discovery, such as <code class="literal">ifconfig</code>, <code class="literal">ip</code>, <code class="literal">netstat</code>, or <code class="literal">route</code>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check the user&#8217;s login history and session details to determine if the account activity aligns with the user&#8217;s normal behavior or if there are signs of unauthorized access, such as logins from unusual IP addresses or at odd times.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate the user&#8217;s role and responsibilities to assess whether they have a legitimate reason to perform network configuration discovery. This can help determine if the activity is expected or suspicious.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Examine recent changes in user permissions or group memberships that might have allowed the execution of network configuration commands by an unexpected user.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Correlate the alert with other security events or logs, such as authentication logs, to identify any related suspicious activities, such as failed login attempts or privilege escalation attempts.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If the account is suspected to be compromised, initiate a password reset and review the system for any signs of further compromise or malicious activity, such as unauthorized software installations or data exfiltration attempts.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>False positive analysis</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Routine administrative tasks by system administrators may trigger the rule. To manage this, create exceptions for known admin accounts performing regular network configuration checks.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Automated scripts or cron jobs that perform network diagnostics can be mistaken for unusual activity. Identify and whitelist these scripts to prevent false alerts.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Network monitoring tools running under specific service accounts might be flagged. Ensure these service accounts are documented and excluded from the rule.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Developers or IT staff conducting legitimate troubleshooting in non-production environments may cause alerts. Establish a process to temporarily exclude these users during known maintenance windows.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
New employees or contractors performing onboarding tasks might trigger the rule. Implement a review process to quickly assess and exclude these cases if they are verified as non-threatening.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Response and remediation</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement by the adversary.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Terminate any suspicious processes or sessions initiated by the unusual user to halt ongoing reconnaissance activities.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Conduct a thorough review of the affected user&#8217;s account for signs of compromise, such as unauthorized access attempts or changes in user privileges.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Reset the credentials of the compromised account and enforce multi-factor authentication to prevent future unauthorized access.

<li class="listitem">
Analyze network logs and system activity to identify any additional systems that may have been accessed or probed by the adversary.

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>This rule requires the installation of associated Machine Learning jobs, as well as data coming in from one of the following integrations:
- Elastic Defend
- Auditd Manager</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Detection Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Once the rule is enabled, the associated Machine Learning job will start automatically. You can view the Machine Learning job linked under the "Definition" panel of the detection rule. If the job does not start due to an error, the issue must be resolved for the job to commence successfully. For more details on setting up anomaly detection jobs, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-ml-anomalies.html" class="ulink" target="_top">helper guide</a>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Defend Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Elastic Defend is integrated into the Elastic Agent using Fleet. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Prerequisite Requirements:</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">

</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Auditd Manager Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>The Auditd Manager Integration receives audit events from the Linux Audit Framework which is a part of the Linux kernel.
Auditd Manager provides a user-friendly interface and automation capabilities for configuring and monitoring system auditing through the auditd daemon. With <code class="literal">auditd_manager</code>, administrators can easily define audit rules, track system events, and generate comprehensive audit reports, improving overall security and compliance in the system.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>The following steps should be executed in order to add the Elastic Agent System integration "auditd_manager" to your system:</strong></span></p>

<li class="listitem">
For more details on the integration refer to the <a href="https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/auditd_manager" class="ulink" target="_top">helper guide</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Rule Specific Setup Note</strong></span></p>
<p>Auditd Manager subscribes to the kernel and receives events as they occur without any additional configuration.
However, if more advanced configuration is required to detect specific behavior, audit rules can be added to the integration in either the "audit rules" configuration box or the "auditd rule files" box by specifying a file to read the audit rules from.
- For this detection rule no additional audit rules are required.</p>
