<p>A machine learning job detected unusually large numbers of DNS queries for a single top-level DNS domain, which is often used for DNS tunneling. DNS tunneling can be used for command-and-control, persistence, or data exfiltration activity. For example, dnscat tends to generate many DNS questions for a top-level domain as it uses the DNS protocol to tunnel data.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating DNS Tunneling</strong></span></p>
<p>DNS tunneling exploits the DNS protocol to covertly transmit data between a compromised system and an attacker-controlled server. Adversaries use it for stealthy command-and-control, persistence, or data exfiltration by embedding data within DNS queries. The detection rule leverages machine learning to identify anomalies, such as an unusually high volume of DNS queries to a single domain, indicating potential tunneling activity.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review the DNS query logs to identify the specific top-level domain generating the unusually high volume of queries. This can help pinpoint the potential source of tunneling activity.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Analyze the source IP addresses associated with the DNS queries to determine if they originate from known or suspicious hosts within the network.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check for any recent changes or anomalies in the network traffic patterns related to the identified domain, which might indicate tunneling or exfiltration attempts.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate the history of the identified domain to assess its reputation and any known associations with malicious activities or threat actors.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Correlate the DNS query activity with other security events or alerts in the network to identify any related suspicious behavior or indicators of compromise.

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
High volume of DNS queries from legitimate software updates or patch management systems can trigger false positives. Users should identify and whitelist domains associated with trusted update services.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Content delivery networks (CDNs) often generate numerous DNS queries due to their distributed nature. Exclude known CDN domains from the analysis to reduce false positives.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Internal network monitoring tools that rely on DNS for service discovery may cause an increase in DNS queries. Consider excluding these internal domains if they are verified as non-threatening.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Some cloud services use DNS for load balancing and may result in high query volumes. Users should review and whitelist these domains if they are confirmed to be safe.

Automated scripts or applications that frequently query DNS for legitimate purposes can be excluded by identifying their specific patterns and adding them to an exception list.

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>This rule requires the installation of associated Machine Learning jobs, as well as data coming in from one of the following integrations:
- Elastic Defend
- Network Packet Capture</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Detection Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Once the rule is enabled, the associated Machine Learning job will start automatically. You can view the Machine Learning job linked under the "Definition" panel of the detection rule. If the job does not start due to an error, the issue must be resolved for the job to commence successfully. For more details on setting up anomaly detection jobs, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-ml-anomalies.html" class="ulink" target="_top">helper guide</a>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Defend Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Elastic Defend is integrated into the Elastic Agent using Fleet. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.</p>
