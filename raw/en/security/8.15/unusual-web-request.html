<p>A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual URL that indicates unusual web browsing activity. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, in a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack, when a trusted website is compromised to target a particular sector or organization, targeted users may receive emails with uncommon URLs for trusted websites. These URLs can be used to download and run a payload. When malware is already running, it may send requests to uncommon URLs on trusted websites the malware uses for command-and-control communication. When rare URLs are observed being requested for a local web server by a remote source, these can be due to web scanning, enumeration or attack traffic, or they can be due to bots and web scrapers which are part of common Internet background traffic.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating Unusual Web Request</strong></span></p>
<p>The <em>Unusual Web Request</em> detection leverages machine learning to identify rare URLs that deviate from typical web activity, potentially signaling malicious actions like initial access or data exfiltration. Adversaries exploit trusted sites by embedding uncommon URLs for payload delivery or command-and-control. This rule flags such anomalies, aiding in early threat detection and response.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review the alert details to identify the specific rare URL that triggered the detection and note any associated IP addresses or domains.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check historical logs to determine if the rare URL has been accessed previously and identify any patterns or trends in its usage.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate the source of the request by examining the user agent, referrer, and originating IP address to assess whether it aligns with known legitimate traffic or appears suspicious.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Analyze the destination of the URL to determine if it is associated with known malicious activity or if it has been flagged in threat intelligence databases.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Correlate the unusual web request with other security events or alerts to identify potential connections to broader attack campaigns or ongoing threats.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Assess the impacted systems or users to determine if there are any signs of compromise, such as unexpected processes, network connections, or data exfiltration attempts.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Consider reaching out to the user or system owner to verify if the access to the rare URL was intentional and legitimate, providing additional context for the investigation.

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>This rule requires the installation of associated Machine Learning jobs, as well as data coming in from one of the following integrations:
- Elastic Defend
- Network Packet Capture</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Detection Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Once the rule is enabled, the associated Machine Learning job will start automatically. You can view the Machine Learning job linked under the "Definition" panel of the detection rule. If the job does not start due to an error, the issue must be resolved for the job to commence successfully. For more details on setting up anomaly detection jobs, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-ml-anomalies.html" class="ulink" target="_top">helper guide</a>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Defend Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
