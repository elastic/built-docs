<p>Elastic AI Assistant can help you enhance and streamline your alert triage workflows by assessing multiple recent alerts in your environment, and helping you interpret an alert and its context.</p>
<p>When you view an alert in Elastic Security, details such as related documents, hosts, and users appear alongside a synopsis of the events that triggered the alert. This data provides a starting point for understanding a potential threat. AI Assistant can answer questions about this data and offer insights and actionable recommendations to remediate the issue.</p>
<p>To enable AI Assistant to answer questions about alerts, you need to provide alert data as context for your prompts. You can either provide multiple alerts using the <a class="xref" href="ai-assistant-knowledge-base.html" title="AI Assistant Knowledge Base">Knowledge Base</a> feature, or provide individual alerts directly.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="ai-assistant-triage-alerts-knowledge-base"></a>Use AI Assistant to triage multiple alerts</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/security-docs/edit/8.16/docs/AI-for-security/usecase-alert-triage.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Enable the <a class="xref" href="ai-assistant-knowledge-base.html" title="AI Assistant Knowledge Base">Knowledge Base</a> <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alerts</strong></span> setting to send AI Assistant data for up to 500 alerts as context for each of your prompts. Use the slider on the Security AI settings' <span class="strong strong"><strong>Knowledge Base</strong></span> tab to select the number of alerts to send to AI Assistant.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to <a class="xref" href="ai-assistant-knowledge-base.html" title="AI Assistant Knowledge Base">Knowledge Base</a>.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="ai-assistant-triage-alerts-instructions"></a>Use AI Assistant to triage a specific alert</h4><a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/security-docs/edit/8.16/docs/AI-for-security/usecase-alert-triage.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Once you have chosen an alert to investigate:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">

<p>(Optional) Click a quick prompt to use it as a starting point for your query, for example <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alert summarization</strong></span>. Improve the quality of AI Assistant&#8217;s response by customizing the prompt and adding detail.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve submitted your query, AI Assistant will process the information and provide a detailed response. Depending on your prompt and the alert data that you included, its response can include a thorough analysis of the alert that highlights key elements such as the nature of the potential threat, potential impact, and suggested response actions.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
(Optional) Ask AI Assistant follow-up questions, provide additional information for further analysis, and request clarification. The response is not a static report.

<p>Elastic AI Assistant can streamline the documentation and report generation process by providing clear records of security incidents, their scope and impact, and your remediation efforts. You can use AI Assistant to create summaries or reports for stakeholders that include key event details, findings, and diagrams. Once the AI Assistant has finished analyzing one or more alerts, you can generate reports by using prompts such as:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
“Generate a detailed report about this incident including timeline, impact analysis, and response actions. Also, include a diagram of events.”
</li>
<li class="listitem">
“Generate a summary of this incident/alert and include diagrams of events.”
</li>
<li class="listitem">
“Provide more details on the mitigation strategies used.”
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>After you review the report, click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Add to existing case</strong></span> at the top of AI Assistant&#8217;s response. This allows you to save a record of the report and make it available to your team.</p>
