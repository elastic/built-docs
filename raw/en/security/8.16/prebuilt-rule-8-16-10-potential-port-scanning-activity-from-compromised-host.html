<p>This rule detects potential port scanning activity from a compromised host. Port scanning is a common reconnaissance technique used by attackers to identify open ports and services on a target system. A compromised host may exhibit port scanning behavior when an attacker is attempting to map out the network topology, identify vulnerable services, or prepare for further exploitation. This rule identifies potential port scanning activity by monitoring network connection attempts from a single host to a large number of ports within a short time frame. ES|QL rules have limited fields available in its alert documents. Make sure to review the original documents to aid in the investigation of this alert.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating Potential Port Scanning Activity from Compromised Host</strong></span></p>
<p>Port scanning is a reconnaissance method used by attackers to identify open ports and services on a network, often as a precursor to exploitation. In Linux environments, compromised hosts may perform rapid connection attempts to numerous ports, signaling potential scanning activity. The detection rule identifies such behavior by analyzing network logs for a high number of distinct port connections from a single host within a short timeframe, indicating possible malicious intent.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review the network logs to identify the specific host exhibiting the port scanning behavior by examining the destination.ip and process.executable fields.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Analyze the @timestamp field to determine the exact time frame of the scanning activity and correlate it with any other suspicious activities or alerts from the same host.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate the process.executable field to understand which application or service initiated the connection attempts, and verify if it is a legitimate process or potentially malicious.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check the destination.port field to identify the range and types of ports targeted by the scanning activity, which may provide insights into the attacker&#8217;s objectives or the services they are interested in.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Assess the host&#8217;s security posture by reviewing recent changes, installed software, and user activity to determine if the host has been compromised or if the scanning is part of legitimate network operations.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Consult the original documents and logs for additional context and details that may not be captured in the alert to aid in a comprehensive investigation.

Legitimate network scanning tools used by system administrators for network maintenance or security assessments can trigger this rule. To handle this, identify and whitelist the IP addresses or processes associated with these tools.

Automated vulnerability scanners or monitoring systems that perform regular checks on network services may cause false positives. Exclude these systems by creating exceptions for their known IP addresses or process names.

High-volume legitimate services that open multiple connections to different ports, such as load balancers or proxy servers, might be flagged. Review and exclude these services by specifying their IP addresses or process executables.

Development or testing environments where frequent port scanning is part of routine operations can be mistakenly identified. Implement exceptions for these environments by excluding their specific network segments or host identifiers.
