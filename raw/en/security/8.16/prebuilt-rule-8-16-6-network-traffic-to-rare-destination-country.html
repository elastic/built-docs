<p>A machine learning job detected a rare destination country name in the network logs. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, when a user clicks on a link in a phishing email or opens a malicious document, a request may be sent to download and run a payload from a server in a country which does not normally appear in network traffic or business work-flows. Malware instances and persistence mechanisms may communicate with command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in their country of origin, which may be an unusual destination country for the source network.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating Network Traffic to Rare Destination Country</strong></span></p>
<p>Machine learning models analyze network logs to identify traffic to uncommon destination countries, which may indicate malicious activities like unauthorized access or data exfiltration. Adversaries exploit this by directing traffic to servers in atypical locations, often linked to command-and-control operations. The detection rule flags such anomalies, aiding in early threat identification and response.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>This rule requires the installation of associated Machine Learning jobs, as well as data coming in from one of the following integrations:
- Elastic Defend
- Network Packet Capture</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Detection Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Once the rule is enabled, the associated Machine Learning job will start automatically. You can view the Machine Learning job linked under the "Definition" panel of the detection rule. If the job does not start due to an error, the issue must be resolved for the job to commence successfully. For more details on setting up anomaly detection jobs, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-ml-anomalies.html" class="ulink" target="_top">helper guide</a>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Defend Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Elastic Defend is integrated into the Elastic Agent using Fleet. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.</p>
