<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating User Added as Owner for Azure Application</strong></span></p>
<p>Azure applications often require specific permissions for functionality, managed by assigning user roles. An adversary might exploit this by adding themselves or a compromised account as an owner, gaining elevated privileges to alter configurations or access sensitive data. The detection rule monitors audit logs for successful operations where a user is added as an application owner, flagging potential unauthorized privilege escalations.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review the Azure audit logs to confirm the operation by filtering for event.dataset:azure.auditlogs and azure.auditlogs.operation_name:"Add owner to application" with a successful outcome.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Identify the user account that was added as an owner and the account that performed the operation to determine if they are legitimate or potentially compromised.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check the history of activities associated with both the added owner and the account that performed the operation to identify any suspicious behavior or patterns.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Verify the application&#8217;s current configuration and permissions to assess any changes made after the new owner was added.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Contact the legitimate owner or administrator of the Azure application to confirm whether the addition of the new owner was authorized.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate any recent changes in the organization&#8217;s user access policies or roles that might explain the addition of a new owner.

<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Routine administrative actions: Regular maintenance or updates by IT staff may involve adding users as application owners. To manage this, create a list of authorized personnel and exclude their actions from triggering alerts.
</li>

Automated processes: Some applications may have automated scripts or services that add users as owners for operational purposes. Identify these processes and configure exceptions for their activities.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Organizational changes: During mergers or restructuring, there may be legitimate reasons for adding multiple users as application owners. Temporarily adjust the rule to accommodate these changes and review the audit logs manually.

Testing and development: In development environments, users may be added as owners for testing purposes. Exclude these environments from the rule or set up a separate monitoring policy with adjusted thresholds.

Review and update access control policies to ensure that only authorized personnel can modify application ownership, and consider implementing stricter approval processes for such changes.
