<p>A machine learning job combination has identified a parent process with one or more suspicious Windows processes that exhibit unusually high malicious probability scores. These process(es) have been classified as malicious in several ways. The process(es) were predicted to be malicious by the ProblemChild supervised ML model. If the anomaly contains a cluster of suspicious processes, each process has the same parent process name, and the aggregate score of the event cluster was calculated to be unusually high by an unsupervised ML model. Such a cluster often contains suspicious or malicious activity, possibly involving LOLbins, that may be resistant to detection using conventional search rules.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating Parent Process Detected with Suspicious Windows Process(es)</strong></span></p>
<p>In Windows environments, processes are often spawned by parent processes, forming a hierarchy. Adversaries exploit this by using legitimate processes to launch malicious ones, often leveraging Living off the Land Binaries (LOLBins) to evade detection. The detection rule employs machine learning to identify clusters of processes with high malicious probability, focusing on those sharing a common parent process. This approach helps uncover stealthy attacks that traditional methods might miss, enhancing defense against tactics like masquerading.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review the parent process name associated with the suspicious process cluster to identify if it is a known legitimate process or a potential masquerading attempt.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Examine the command line arguments and execution context of the suspicious processes to identify any use of LOLBins or unusual patterns that could indicate malicious activity.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check the process creation timestamps and correlate them with any known events or user activities to determine if the process execution aligns with expected behavior.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate the network activity of the suspicious processes to identify any unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Analyze the user account context under which the suspicious processes were executed to determine if there is any indication of compromised credentials or privilege escalation.

<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Legitimate administrative tools may trigger false positives if they frequently spawn processes that resemble malicious activity. Users can create exceptions for known safe tools by whitelisting their parent process names.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Software updates or installations often generate clusters of processes that might be flagged as suspicious. Users should monitor these activities and exclude them if they are verified as legitimate.

<li class="listitem">
Automated scripts or batch jobs that run regularly and spawn multiple processes can be mistaken for malicious clusters. Identifying these scripts and excluding their parent processes can reduce false positives.

Security software or monitoring tools that perform regular scans or updates might mimic malicious behavior. Users should ensure these tools are recognized and excluded from the rule&#8217;s scope.
