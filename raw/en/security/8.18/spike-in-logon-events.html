<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating Spike in Logon Events</strong></span></p>
<p>The <em>Spike in Logon Events</em> detection leverages machine learning to identify anomalies in authentication patterns, signaling potential threats like password spraying or brute force attacks. Adversaries exploit these methods to gain unauthorized access by overwhelming systems with login attempts. This rule detects unusual surges in successful logins, indicating possible credential access tactics, and aids in preemptive threat mitigation.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review the timestamp and source of the spike in logon events to determine the time frame and systems affected.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Analyze the user accounts involved in the spike to identify any patterns or anomalies, such as accounts with multiple logins from different locations or IP addresses.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check for any recent changes in user permissions or roles that could explain the increase in logon events.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate the IP addresses associated with the logon events to identify any known malicious sources or unusual geographic locations.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Correlate the logon events with other security alerts or logs, such as failed login attempts, to identify potential password spraying or brute force activities.

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>This rule requires the installation of associated Machine Learning jobs, as well as data coming in from one of the following integrations:
- Elastic Defend
- Auditd Manager
- System</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Detection Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Once the rule is enabled, the associated Machine Learning job will start automatically. You can view the Machine Learning job linked under the "Definition" panel of the detection rule. If the job does not start due to an error, the issue must be resolved for the job to commence successfully. For more details on setting up anomaly detection jobs, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-ml-anomalies.html" class="ulink" target="_top">helper guide</a>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Defend Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Elastic Defend is integrated into the Elastic Agent using Fleet. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Auditd Manager Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>The Auditd Manager Integration receives audit events from the Linux Audit Framework which is a part of the Linux kernel.
Auditd Manager provides a user-friendly interface and automation capabilities for configuring and monitoring system auditing through the auditd daemon. With <code class="literal">auditd_manager</code>, administrators can easily define audit rules, track system events, and generate comprehensive audit reports, improving overall security and compliance in the system.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Rule Specific Setup Note</strong></span></p>
<p>Auditd Manager subscribes to the kernel and receives events as they occur without any additional configuration.
However, if more advanced configuration is required to detect specific behavior, audit rules can be added to the integration in either the "audit rules" configuration box or the "auditd rule files" box by specifying a file to read the audit rules from.
- For this detection rule no additional audit rules are required.</p>
