<p>Looks for commands related to system process discovery from an unusual user context. This can be due to uncommon troubleshooting activity or due to a compromised account. A compromised account may be used by a threat actor to engage in system process discovery in order to increase their understanding of software applications running on a target host or network. This may be a precursor to selection of a persistence mechanism or a method of privilege elevation.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating Unusual Linux Process Discovery Activity</strong></span></p>
<p>In Linux environments, process discovery commands help users and administrators understand active processes, aiding in system management and troubleshooting. However, adversaries can exploit these commands to map running applications, potentially identifying vulnerabilities for privilege escalation or persistence. The detection rule leverages machine learning to identify atypical usage patterns, flagging potential threats when process discovery occurs from unexpected user contexts, thus helping to preemptively mitigate risks associated with compromised accounts.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review the user context from which the process discovery command was executed to determine if the user account is expected to perform such actions.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check the command history for the user account to identify any other unusual or unauthorized commands executed around the same time.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Analyze the process discovery command details, including the specific command used and its parameters, to understand the intent and scope of the activity.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate the source IP address and host from which the command was executed to verify if it aligns with known and authorized devices for the user.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Examine recent authentication logs for the user account to identify any suspicious login attempts or anomalies in login patterns.

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>This rule requires the installation of associated Machine Learning jobs, as well as data coming in from one of the following integrations:
- Elastic Defend
- Auditd Manager</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Detection Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Once the rule is enabled, the associated Machine Learning job will start automatically. You can view the Machine Learning job linked under the "Definition" panel of the detection rule. If the job does not start due to an error, the issue must be resolved for the job to commence successfully. For more details on setting up anomaly detection jobs, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-ml-anomalies.html" class="ulink" target="_top">helper guide</a>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Defend Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Elastic Defend is integrated into the Elastic Agent using Fleet. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Auditd Manager Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>The Auditd Manager Integration receives audit events from the Linux Audit Framework which is a part of the Linux kernel.
Auditd Manager provides a user-friendly interface and automation capabilities for configuring and monitoring system auditing through the auditd daemon. With <code class="literal">auditd_manager</code>, administrators can easily define audit rules, track system events, and generate comprehensive audit reports, improving overall security and compliance in the system.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>The following steps should be executed in order to add the Elastic Agent System integration "auditd_manager" to your system:</strong></span></p>

<li class="listitem">
For more details on the integration refer to the <a href="https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/auditd_manager" class="ulink" target="_top">helper guide</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Rule Specific Setup Note</strong></span></p>
<p>Auditd Manager subscribes to the kernel and receives events as they occur without any additional configuration.
However, if more advanced configuration is required to detect specific behavior, audit rules can be added to the integration in either the "audit rules" configuration box or the "auditd rule files" box by specifying a file to read the audit rules from.
- For this detection rule no additional audit rules are required.</p>
