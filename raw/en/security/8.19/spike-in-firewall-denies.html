<p>A machine learning job detected an unusually large spike in network traffic that was denied by network access control lists (ACLs) or firewall rules. Such a burst of denied traffic is usually caused by either 1) a mis-configured application or firewall or 2) suspicious or malicious activity. Unsuccessful attempts at network transit, in order to connect to command-and-control (C2), or engage in data exfiltration, may produce a burst of failed connections. This could also be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic. Denial-of-service attacks or traffic floods may also produce such a surge in traffic.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating Spike in Firewall Denies</strong></span></p>
<p>Firewalls and ACLs are critical in controlling network traffic, blocking unauthorized access. Adversaries may exploit misconfigurations or launch attacks like reconnaissance or denial-of-service to overwhelm these defenses. The <em>Spike in Firewall Denies</em> detection rule leverages machine learning to identify unusual surges in denied traffic, signaling potential misconfigurations or malicious activities.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review the time frame and source IP addresses associated with the spike in denied traffic to identify any patterns or anomalies.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check the firewall and ACL logs for any recent changes or misconfigurations that could have led to the increase in denied traffic.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate the destination IP addresses and ports targeted by the denied traffic to determine if they are associated with known malicious activity or if they are legitimate services.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Analyze the volume and frequency of the denied requests to assess whether they align with typical denial-of-service attack patterns or reconnaissance activities.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Correlate the denied traffic with other security alerts or logs to identify any related suspicious activities or potential indicators of compromise within the network.

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">

Routine network scans by security tools or IT teams may trigger spikes in denied traffic. Regularly review and whitelist known IP addresses or tools to prevent these from being flagged.

Misconfigured applications that frequently attempt unauthorized access can cause false positives. Identify and correct these configurations to reduce unnecessary alerts.

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>This rule requires the installation of associated Machine Learning jobs, as well as data coming in from one of the following integrations:
- Elastic Defend
- Network Packet Capture</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Detection Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Once the rule is enabled, the associated Machine Learning job will start automatically. You can view the Machine Learning job linked under the "Definition" panel of the detection rule. If the job does not start due to an error, the issue must be resolved for the job to commence successfully. For more details on setting up anomaly detection jobs, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-ml-anomalies.html" class="ulink" target="_top">helper guide</a>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Defend Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Elastic Defend is integrated into the Elastic Agent using Fleet. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.</p>
