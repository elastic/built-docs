<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating Spike in host-based traffic</strong></span></p>
<p>The detection of a spike in host-based traffic leverages machine learning to identify anomalies in network behavior, which may indicate security threats like DDoS attacks or data exfiltration. Adversaries exploit this by overwhelming systems or stealthily transferring data. The rule, with a low severity score, flags unusual traffic patterns, enabling analysts to investigate potential compromises or misconfigurations.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review the timestamp and source of the traffic spike to determine the exact time and origin of the anomaly.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Analyze the affected host&#8217;s network logs to identify any unusual outbound or inbound connections that coincide with the spike.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check for any recent changes or updates on the affected host that might have triggered the spike, such as software installations or configuration changes.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate any associated user accounts for signs of unauthorized access or privilege escalation activities.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Correlate the spike with other security alerts or logs to identify potential patterns or related incidents.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Assess the host for signs of malware infection or indicators of compromise that could explain the abnormal traffic behavior.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>False positive analysis</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Routine software updates or patch management activities can cause temporary spikes in host-based traffic. Users should monitor scheduled update times and create exceptions for these periods to avoid false positives.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Backup operations often generate increased network traffic. Identifying and excluding these regular backup windows from monitoring can help reduce false alerts.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
High-volume data transfers within the organization, such as large file uploads or downloads for legitimate business purposes, may trigger the rule. Establishing baseline traffic patterns for these activities and setting exceptions can mitigate unnecessary alerts.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Automated scripts or batch processes that run at specific times and generate predictable traffic spikes should be documented and excluded from anomaly detection to prevent false positives.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Internal network scans or vulnerability assessments conducted by IT security teams can mimic malicious traffic patterns. These should be scheduled and whitelisted to avoid triggering the rule.

<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or participation in a DDoS attack.

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>This rule requires the installation of associated Machine Learning jobs, as well as data coming in from one of the following integrations:
- Elastic Defend</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Detection Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Once the rule is enabled, the associated Machine Learning job will start automatically. You can view the Machine Learning job linked under the "Definition" panel of the detection rule. If the job does not start due to an error, the issue must be resolved for the job to commence successfully. For more details on setting up anomaly detection jobs, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-ml-anomalies.html" class="ulink" target="_top">helper guide</a>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Defend Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Elastic Defend is integrated into the Elastic Agent using Fleet. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Prerequisite Requirements:</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Fleet is required for Elastic Defend.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To configure Fleet Server refer to the <a href="/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html" class="ulink" target="_top">documentation</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>The following steps should be executed in order to add the Elastic Defend integration to your system:</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Go to the Kibana home page and click "Add integrations".
</li>
<li class="listitem">
In the query bar, search for "Elastic Defend" and select the integration to see more details about it.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Click "Add Elastic Defend".
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Select the type of environment you want to protect, either "Traditional Endpoints" or "Cloud Workloads".
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Select a configuration preset. Each preset comes with different default settings for Elastic Agent, you can further customize these later by configuring the Elastic Defend integration policy. <a href="/guide/en/security/current/configure-endpoint-integration-policy.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Helper guide</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
We suggest selecting "Complete EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)" as a configuration setting, that provides "All events; all preventions"
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Enter a name for the agent policy in "New agent policy name". If other agent policies already exist, you can click the "Existing hosts" tab and select an existing policy instead.
For more details on Elastic Agent configuration settings, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/fleet/current/agent-policy.html" class="ulink" target="_top">helper guide</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Click "Save and Continue".
</li>
<li class="listitem">
To complete the integration, select "Add Elastic Agent to your hosts" and continue to the next section to install the Elastic Agent on your hosts.
