<p>Rolling upgrades are unsupported in Elastic Security, which runs within the Kibana application. To upgrade, you must shut down all Kibana instances, install the new software, and restart Kibana.
Upgrading while older Kibana instances are running can cause data loss or upgrade failures.</p>

<p>When upgrading several Kibana instances connected to the same Elasticsearch cluster,
ensure that all outdated instances are shut down before starting the upgrade.</p>
<p>Rolling upgrades are unsupported in Kibana. However, when outdated instances are shut down, you can start all upgraded instances in parallel,
which allows all instances to participate in the upgrade migration in parallel.</p>
<p>For large deployments with more than 10 Kibana instances and more than 10,000 saved objects,
you can reduce the upgrade downtime by bringing up a single Kibana instance and waiting for it to
complete the upgrade migration before bringing up the remaining instances.</p>

Plan for an appropriate amount of time to complete the upgrade. Depending on your configuration and the size of your cluster, the process can take up to a week to complete.

<li class="listitem">
Review your selected version&#8217;s features, Elastic connectors, integrations, and detection rules to determine if you can replace any customized content with out-of-the-box functionality. This can help reduce your workload and the complexity of your upgrade.

<p>To upgrade from 7.16.0 or earlier to 8.19.6, you must first upgrade your Elastic Stack and Elastic Agents to 7.17 (refer to <a href="/guide/en/fleet/8.19/upgrade-elastic-agent.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrade Fleet-managed Elastic Agents</a>). This enables you to use the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.19/upgrade-assistant.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrade Assistant</a> to prepare for the upgrade. Before you upgrade, you must resolve all critical issues identified by the Upgrade Assistant. Afterwards, you can <a class="xref" href="upgrade-7.17-8x.html" title="Upgrade from 7.17 to an 8.x version">upgrade to 8.x</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, Elastic Agents will be version 7.17. This is fine because Elastic Security 8.x supports the last minor release in 7.x (7.17) and any subsequent Elastic Endpoint versions in 8.x. After the Elastic Stack upgrade, you can decide whether to upgrade Elastic Agents to 8.x, which is recommended to ensure you get the latest features.</p>
