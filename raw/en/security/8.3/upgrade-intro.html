<p>We highly recommend that all Elastic Security users keep their deployments up to date with the latest available Elastic Stack version to access new features, security updates, and performance enhancements. This topic describes updates in 8.0 that require changes to your agents, existing data, user privileges, or system preferences.</p>
<p>For upgrading to the latest Elastic Stack version, we recommend using the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/8.3/upgrade-assistant.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana Upgrade Assistant</a>.</p>

<p>Upgrade your Elastic Stack and Elastic Agents to 7.17 first (refer to <a href="/guide/en/fleet/8.3/upgrade-elastic-agent.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Upgrade Fleet-managed Elastic Agents</a>). Afterwards, you can <a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack/8.3/upgrading-elastic-stack.html" class="ulink" target="_top">upgrade the Elastic Stack</a> to 8.x. Initially, Elastic Agents will be version 7.17; this is fine because Elastic Security 8.x supports the last minor release in 7.x (7.17) and any subsequent Elastic Endpoint versions in 8.x. After the Elastic Stack upgrade, you can decide whether to upgrade Elastic Agents to 8.0, which is recommended to ensure you get the latest features.</p>

<p>Upon upgrading to 8.0, rules are automatically disabled. Once the upgrade completes, you should re-enable them again to avoid gaps in rule coverage. <em>We highly recommend that you track your active rules before upgrading so you can easily find and re-enable them after upgrading to 8.0</em>.</p>
<p>Before upgrading, use the <a class="xref" href="rules-api-find.html" title="Find rules">Find rules API</a> to capture a list of enabled rules.</p>

<p>Any rules that are active when you upgrade from 7.17 to 8.0.1 or newer are automatically disabled, and a tag named <code class="literal">auto_disabled_8.0</code> is added to those rules for tracking purposes.

<p>When you manually install Elastic Endpoint, you must approve a system extension, kernel extension, and enable Full Disk Access (FDA). There is a new FDA requirement in 8.0.

<p>To make the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Data view</strong></span> option appear in an environment with legacy alerts, a user with elevated role privileges must visit the Elastic Security app, open a page that displays alert data (such as the Overview page), then refresh the page. The user&#8217;s role privileges must allow them to enable the detections feature in a Kibana space.

<p>The system index for detection alerts has been renamed from <code class="literal">.siem-signals-&lt;space-id&gt;</code> to <code class="literal">.alerts-security.alerts-&lt;space-id&gt;</code> and is now a hidden index. Therefore, the schema used for alert documents in Elastic Security has changed. Users that access documents in the <code class="literal">.siem-signals</code> indices using the Elastic Security API must modify their API queries and scripts to operate properly on the new 8.0 alert documents.

<h3><a id="im-rules-upgrade"></a>Updates to indictor match rules<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/security-docs/edit/8.3/docs/upgrade/upgrade-security.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Changes to the indicator match rule&#8217;s <a class="xref" href="rules-ui-create.html#rule-ui-advanced-params" title="Configure advanced rule settings (optional)">default threat indicator path</a> might require you to update existing rules, or create new ones, after upgrading to 8.0. Be mindful of the following:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
If an indicator match rule&#8217;s default threat indicator path was not defined before the upgrade, it will default to <code class="literal">threatintel.indicator</code> after the upgrade. This allows the rule to continue using indicator data ingested by Filebeat version 7.x. If a custom value was defined before the upgrade, the value will not change.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
If an existing indicator match rule was configured to use threat indicator indices generated from Filebeat version 7.x, updating the default threat indicator path to <code class="literal">threat.indicator</code> after you upgrade to Elastic Stack version 8.0 and Elastic Agent or Filebeat version 8.0 configures the rule to use threat indicator indices generated by those later versions.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
You must create separate rules to query threat intelligence indices created by Filebeat version 7.x and version 8.0 because each version requires a different default threat indicator path value. Review the recommendations for <a class="xref" href="query-alert-indices.html" title="Query alert indices">querying alert indices</a>.
