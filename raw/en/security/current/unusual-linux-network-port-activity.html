<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating Unusual Linux Network Port Activity</strong></span></p>
<p>In Linux environments, network ports facilitate communication between applications and services. Adversaries may exploit rarely used ports for covert command-and-control, persistence, or data exfiltration, bypassing standard monitoring. The <em>Unusual Linux Network Port Activity</em> detection rule leverages machine learning to identify anomalies in port usage, flagging potential unauthorized access or threat actor activity by highlighting deviations from typical network behavior.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review the alert details to identify the specific unusual destination port and the associated source and destination IP addresses.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check historical network logs to determine if the identified port has been used previously and assess the frequency and context of its usage.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate the source IP address to determine if it is associated with known internal systems or if it is an external or unexpected source.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Analyze the destination IP address to verify if it is a legitimate endpoint within the network or an external entity that requires further scrutiny.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Correlate the unusual port activity with any recent changes or updates in the network environment that might explain the anomaly.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Examine any related process or application logs on the involved Linux systems to identify the application or service responsible for the network activity.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Consider reaching out to the system owner or administrator for additional context or to verify if the activity is expected or authorized.

</ul>
</div>

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Routine administrative tasks may trigger alerts when using non-standard ports for legitimate purposes. Users can create exceptions for known administrative tools and scripts that consistently use these ports.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Internal applications or services might use uncommon ports for inter-service communication. Identify these applications and whitelist their port usage to prevent unnecessary alerts.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Security tools and monitoring solutions sometimes scan or probe network ports as part of their operations. Recognize these tools and exclude their activities from the rule to avoid false positives.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Development and testing environments often experiment with various port configurations. Establish a separate monitoring profile for these environments to reduce noise in production alerts.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Custom or legacy applications may operate on non-standard ports due to historical configurations. Document these applications and adjust the rule to accommodate their expected behavior.

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>This rule requires the installation of associated Machine Learning jobs, as well as data coming in from one of the following integrations:
- Elastic Defend
- Auditd Manager</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Detection Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Once the rule is enabled, the associated Machine Learning job will start automatically. You can view the Machine Learning job linked under the "Definition" panel of the detection rule. If the job does not start due to an error, the issue must be resolved for the job to commence successfully. For more details on setting up anomaly detection jobs, refer to the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-ml-anomalies.html" class="ulink" target="_top">helper guide</a>.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Elastic Defend Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>Elastic Defend is integrated into the Elastic Agent using Fleet. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Prerequisite Requirements:</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Fleet is required for Elastic Defend.

</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Auditd Manager Integration Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>The Auditd Manager Integration receives audit events from the Linux Audit Framework which is a part of the Linux kernel.
Auditd Manager provides a user-friendly interface and automation capabilities for configuring and monitoring system auditing through the auditd daemon. With <code class="literal">auditd_manager</code>, administrators can easily define audit rules, track system events, and generate comprehensive audit reports, improving overall security and compliance in the system.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>The following steps should be executed in order to add the Elastic Agent System integration "auditd_manager" to your system:</strong></span></p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Rule Specific Setup Note</strong></span></p>
<p>Auditd Manager subscribes to the kernel and receives events as they occur without any additional configuration.
However, if more advanced configuration is required to detect specific behavior, audit rules can be added to the integration in either the "audit rules" configuration box or the "auditd rule files" box by specifying a file to read the audit rules from.
- For this detection rule no additional audit rules are required.</p>
