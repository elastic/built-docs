<p>A machine learning job has detected a suspicious Windows process. This process has been classified as malicious in two ways. It was predicted to be malicious by the ProblemChild supervised ML model, and it was found to be an unusual child process name, for the parent process, by an unsupervised ML model. Such a process may be an instance of suspicious or malicious activity, possibly involving LOLbins, that may be resistant to detection using conventional search rules.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Investigating Unusual Process Spawned by a Parent Process</strong></span></p>
<p>In Windows environments, processes are often spawned by parent processes to perform legitimate tasks. However, adversaries can exploit this by using legitimate tools, known as LOLbins, to execute malicious activities stealthily. The detection rule leverages machine learning to identify anomalies in process creation patterns, flagging processes that deviate from typical behavior, thus uncovering potential threats that evade traditional detection methods.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Possible investigation steps</strong></span></p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Review the parent process and child process names to determine if they are known legitimate applications or if they are commonly associated with LOLbins or other malicious activities.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Check the process creation time and correlate it with any known user activity or scheduled tasks to identify if the process execution aligns with expected behavior.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Investigate the command line arguments used by the suspicious process to identify any unusual or potentially malicious commands or scripts being executed.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Analyze the network activity associated with the process to detect any suspicious outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Examine the file path and hash of the executable to verify its legitimacy and check against known malware databases or threat intelligence sources.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Review any recent changes to the system, such as software installations or updates, that might explain the unusual process behavior.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Consult endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs or other security tools to gather additional context and evidence related to the process and its activities.

<li class="listitem">
Legitimate administrative tools like PowerShell or command prompt may be flagged when used for routine tasks. Users can create exceptions for these tools when executed by known and trusted parent processes.

Software updates or installations often spawn processes that might appear unusual. Exclude these processes by identifying their typical parent-child relationships during updates.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Custom scripts or automation tools used within the organization might trigger alerts. Document these scripts and their expected behavior to create exceptions for them.

Frequent use of remote management tools can lead to false positives. Ensure these tools are whitelisted when used by authorized personnel.
