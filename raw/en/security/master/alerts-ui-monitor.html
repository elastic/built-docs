<p>To view a summary of all rule executions, including the most recent failures and execution
times, select the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Rule Monitoring</strong></span> tab on the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Rules</strong></span> page (<span class="strong strong"><strong>Manage</strong></span> &#8594;

<p>For detailed information on a rule, the alerts it generated, and associated errors, click on its name in the table. This also allows you to perform the same actions that are available on the <a class="xref" href="rules-ui-management.html" title="Manage detection rules"><span class="strong strong"><strong>Rules</strong></span> tab</a>, such as modifying or deleting rules, activating or deactivating rules, exporting or importing rules, and duplicating prebuilt rules.</p>

<p>Each detection rule execution is logged, including its success or failure, any warning or error messages, and how long it took to search for data, create alerts, and complete. This can help you troubleshoot a particular rule if it isn&#8217;t behaving as expected (for example, if it isn&#8217;t creating alerts or takes a long time to run).</p>
<p>To access a rule&#8217;s execution log, go to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Manage</strong></span> &#8594; <span class="strong strong"><strong>Rules</strong></span>, click the rule&#8217;s name to open its details, then scroll down and select the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Execution results</strong></span> tab.</p>

<p>When a rule fails to run close to its scheduled time, some alerts may be
missing. There are a number of ways to try to resolve this issue:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">

<p>You can also use Task Manager in Kibana to troubleshoot background tasks and processes that may be related to missing alerts:</p>

<p>If you see values in the Gaps column in the Rule Monitoring table or on the Rule details page
for a small number of rules, you can increase those rules'
Additional look-back time (<span class="strong strong"><strong>Manage</strong></span> &#8594; <span class="strong strong"><strong>Rules</strong></span> &#8594; the rule&#8217;s <span class="strong strong"><strong>All actions</strong></span> menu (<span class="strong strong"><strong>&#8230;&#8203;</strong></span>) &#8594; <span class="strong strong"><strong>Edit rule settings</strong></span> &#8594; <span class="strong strong"><strong>Schedule</strong></span> &#8594; <span class="strong strong"><strong>Additional look-back time</strong></span>).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s recommended to set the <code class="literal">Additional look-back time</code> to at
least 1 minute. This ensures there are no missing alerts when a rule doesn&#8217;t
run exactly at its scheduled time.</p>
<p>Elastic Security prevents duplication. Any duplicate alerts that are discovered during the
<code class="literal">Additional look-back time</code> are <em>not</em> created.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If the rule that experiences gaps is an indicator match rule, see <a class="xref" href="tuning-detection-signals.html#tune-indicator-rules" title="Tune indicator match rules">how to tune indicator match rules</a>.

<p>If you see gaps for numerous rules:</p>

<ul class="itemizedlist">

If you restarted Kibana when many rules were activated, try deactivating them

Consider adding another Kibana instance to your environment.

<h4><a id="troubleshoot-ingestion-pipeline-delay"></a>Troubleshoot ingestion pipeline delay<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/security-docs/edit/main/docs/detections/rules-ui-monitor.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Even if your rule runs at its scheduled time, there might still be missing alerts if your ingestion pipeline delay is greater than your rule interval + additional look-back time. Prebuilt rules have a minimum interval + additional look-back time of 6 minutes in Elastic Stack version &gt;=7.11.0. To avoid missed alerts for prebuilt rules, use caution to ensure that ingestion pipeline delays remain below 6 minutes.</p>
<p>In addition, use caution when creating custom rule schedules to ensure that the specified interval + additional look-back time is greater than your deployment&#8217;s ingestion pipeline delay.</p>
<p>You can reduce the number of missed alerts due to ingestion pipeline delay by specifying the <code class="literal">Timestamp override</code> field value to <code class="literal">event.ingested</code> in <a class="xref" href="rules-ui-create.html#rule-ui-advanced-params" title="Configure advanced rule settings (optional)">advanced settings</a> during rule creation or editing. The detection engine uses the value from the <code class="literal">event.ingested</code> field as the timestamp when executing the rule.</p>
<p>For example, say an event occurred at 10:00 but wasn&#8217;t ingested into Elasticsearch until 10:10 due to an ingestion pipeline delay. If you created a rule to detect that event with an interval + additional look-back time of 6 minutes, and the rule executes at 10:12, it would still detect the event because the <code class="literal">event.ingested</code> timestamp was from 10:10, only 2 minutes before the rule executed and well within the rule&#8217;s 6-minute interval + additional look-back time.</p>

<p>Machine learning detection rules use machine learning jobs that have dependencies on data fields populated by the Beats and Elastic Agent integrations. In Elastic Stack version 8.3, new machine learning jobs (prefixed with <code class="literal">v3</code>) were released to operate on the ECS fields available at that time.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using 8.2 or earlier versions of Beats or Elastic Agent with Elastic Stack version 8.3 or later, you may need to duplicate prebuilt rules or create new custom rules <em>before</em> you update the Elastic prebuilt rules. Once you update the prebuilt rules, they will only use <code class="literal">v3</code> machine learning jobs. Duplicating the relevant prebuilt rules before updating them ensures continued coverage by allowing you to keep using <code class="literal">v1</code> or <code class="literal">v2</code> jobs (in the duplicated rules) while also running the new <code class="literal">v3</code> jobs (in the updated prebuilt rules).</p>
