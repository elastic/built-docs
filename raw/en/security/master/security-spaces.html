<p>Elastic Security supports the organization of your security operations into
logical instances with the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/master/xpack-spaces.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana spaces</a>
feature. Each space in Kibana represents a separate logical instance of
Elastic Security in which detection rules, rule exceptions, value lists,
alerts, Timelines, cases, and Kibana advanced settings are private to the
space and accessible only by users that have role privileges to
access the space. For details about configuring privileges for
Elasticsearch and Kibana, refer to <a class="xref" href="detections-permissions-section.html" title="Detections prerequisites and requirements">Detections prerequisites and requirements</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if you create a <code class="literal">SOC_prod</code> space in which you load and
activate all the Elastic Security prebuilt detection rules, these rules and
any detection alerts they generate will be accessible only when visiting
the Elastic Security app in the <code class="literal">SOC_prod</code> space. If you then create a new
<code class="literal">SOC_dev</code> space, you&#8217;ll notice that no detection rules or alerts are
present. Any rules subsequently loaded or created here will be private to
the <code class="literal">SOC_dev</code> space, and they will run independently of those in the
<code class="literal">SOC_prod</code> space.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>By default, alerts created by detection rules are stored in Elasticsearch indices
under the <code class="literal">.alerts-security.alerts-&lt;Kibana-space&gt;</code> index pattern, and they may be
accessed by any user with role privileges to access those
Elasticsearch indices. In our example above, any user with Elasticsearch privileges to access
<code class="literal">.alerts-security.alerts-SOC_prod</code> will be able to view <code class="literal">SOC_prod</code> alerts from
within Elasticsearch and other Kibana apps such as Discover and Lens.</p>
<p>To ensure that detection alert data remains private to the space in which
it was created, ensure that the roles assigned to your Elastic Security users
include Elasticsearch privileges that limit their access to alerts
within their space&#8217;s alerts index.</p>
