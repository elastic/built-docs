<p>Use the detection engine to create and manage rules and view the alerts
these rules create. Rules periodically search indices (such as <code class="literal">logs-*</code> and
<code class="literal">filebeat-*</code>) for suspicious source events and create alerts when a rule&#8217;s
conditions are met. When an alert is created, its status is <code class="literal">Open</code>. To help
track investigations, an alert&#8217;s <a class="xref" href="security-alerts-manage.html#detection-alert-status" title="Change an alert&#8217;s status">status</a> can be set as
<code class="literal">Open</code>, <code class="literal">Acknowledged</code>, or <code class="literal">Closed</code>.</p>

<p>In addition to creating <a class="xref" href="security-rules-create.html" title="Create a detection rule">your own rules</a>, enable
<a class="xref" href="security-prebuilt-rules-management.html#load-prebuilt-rules" title="Install and enable Elastic prebuilt rules">Elastic prebuilt rules</a> to immediately start detecting
suspicious activity. For detailed information on all the prebuilt rules, see the <a class="xref" href="security-prebuilt-rules.html" title="Prebuilt rule reference">Prebuilt rules reference</a>. Once the prebuilt rules are loaded and
running, <a class="xref" href="security-tune-detection-signals.html" title="Tune detection rules">Tune detection rules</a> and <a class="xref" href="security-add-exceptions.html" title="Add and manage exceptions">Add and manage exceptions</a> explain
how to modify the rules to reduce false positives and get a better set of
actionable alerts. You can also use exceptions and value lists when creating or
modifying your own rules.</p>
<p>There are several special prebuilt rules you need to know about:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<a class="xref" href="endpoint-protection-rules.html" title="Endpoint protection rules"><span class="strong strong"><strong>Endpoint protection rules</strong></span></a>: Automatically create alerts based on Elastic Defend&#8217;s threat monitoring and prevention.

<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>External Alerts</strong></span>: Automatically creates an alert for
all incoming third-party system alerts (for example, Suricata alerts).

<p>If you want to receive notifications via external systems, such as Slack or
email, when alerts are created, use the <a href="/guide/en/kibana/master/alerting-getting-started.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Alerting and Actions</a> framework.</p>
<p>After rules have started running, you can monitor their executions to verify
they are functioning correctly, as well as view, manage, and troubleshoot
alerts (see <a class="xref" href="security-alerts-manage.html" title="Manage detection alerts">Manage detection alerts</a> and <a class="xref" href="security-alerts-ui-monitor.html" title="Monitor and troubleshoot rule executions">Monitor and troubleshoot rule executions</a>).</p>
<p>You can create and manage rules and alerts via the UI or the <a href="/guide/en/security/master/rule-api-overview.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Detections API</a>.</p>

<p>Indicator match rules provide a powerful capability to search your security data; however, their queries can consume significant deployment resources. When creating an <a class="xref" href="security-rules-create.html#create-indicator-rule" title="Create an indicator match rule">indicator match rule</a>, we recommend limiting the time range of the indicator index query to the minimum period necessary for the desired rule coverage. For example, the default indicator index query <code class="literal">@timestamp &gt; "now-30d/d"</code> searches specified indicator indices for indicators ingested during the past 30 days and rounds the query start time down to the nearest day (resolves to UTC <code class="literal">00:00:00</code>). Without this limitation, the rule will include all of the indicators in your indicator indices, which may extend the time it takes for the indicator index query to complete.</p>
<p>In addition, indicator match rules with an additional look-back time value greater than 24 hours are not supported.</p>

<p>Malware, short for malicious software, is any software program designed to damage or execute unauthorized actions on a
computer system. Examples of malware include viruses, worms, Trojan horses, adware, scareware, and spyware. Some
malware, such as viruses, can severely damage a computer&#8217;s hard drive by deleting files or directory information. Other
malware, such as spyware, can obtain user data without their knowledge.</p>
<p>Malware may be stealthy and appear as legitimate executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. It is also
often embedded in non-malicious files, non-suspicious websites, and standard programs — sometimes making the root
source difficult to identify. If infected and not resolved promptly, malware can cause irreparable damage to a computer
network.</p>

<div class="position-relative"><h5><a id="machine-learning-model"></a>Machine learning model</h5><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/security-docs/edit/main/docs/serverless/rules/detection-engine-overview.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>To determine if a file is malicious or benign, a machine learning model looks for static attributes of files (without executing
the file) that include file structure, layout, and content. This includes information such as file header data, imports, exports,
section names, and file size. These attributes are extracted from millions of benign and malicious file samples, which then
are passed to a machine-learning algorithm that distinguishes a benign file from a malicious one. The machine learning
model is updated as new data is procured and analyzed.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h5><a id="security-detection-engine-overview-threshold"></a>Threshold</h5><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/security-docs/edit/main/docs/serverless/rules/detection-engine-overview.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>A malware threshold determines the action the agent should take if malware is detected. The Elastic Agent uses a recommended threshold level that generates a balanced number of alerts with a low probability of undetected malware. This threshold also minimizes the number of false positive alerts.</p>
<div class="position-relative"><h4><a id="ransomware-prevention"></a>Ransomware prevention</h4><a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/security-docs/edit/main/docs/serverless/rules/detection-engine-overview.asciidoc">edit</a></div>
<p>Ransomware is computer malware that installs discreetly on a user&#8217;s computer and encrypts data until a specified amount of money (ransom) is paid. Ransomware is usually similar to other malware in its delivery and execution, infecting systems
through spear-phishing or drive-by downloads. If not resolved immediately, ransomware can cause irreparable damage to an entire computer network.</p>
<p>Behavioral ransomware prevention on the Elastic Endpoint detects and stops ransomware attacks on Windows systems by analyzing data from low-level system processes, and is effective across an array of widespread ransomware families — including those targeting the system’s master boot record.</p>

<p>Depending on your user role privileges and whether detection system indices have already been created, you might get one of these error messages when you
