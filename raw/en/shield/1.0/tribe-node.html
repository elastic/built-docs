<p>Shield supports the <a href="http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/modules-tribe.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Tribe Node</a>, which acts as a federated client across multiple clusters.
When using Tribe Node with Shield, you must have the same Shield configurations (users, roles, user-role mappings, SSL/TLS CA)
on each cluster, and on the Tribe Node itself, where security checking is primarily done. This, of course, also means
that all clusters must be running Shield. The following are the current limitations to keep in mind when using the
Tribe Node in combination with Shield.</p>
<h3><a id="_same_privileges_on_all_connected_clusters"></a>Same privileges on all connected clusters<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack/edit/shield-1.0/docs/public/shield/appendices/05-tribe-node.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The Tribe Node has its own configuration and privileges, which need to grant access to actions and indices on all of the
connected clusters. Also, each cluster needs to grant access to indices belonging to other connected clusters as well.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example: assuming we have two clusters, <code class="literal">cluster1</code> and <code class="literal">cluster2</code>, each one holding an index, <code class="literal">index1</code>
and <code class="literal">index2</code>. A search request that targets multiple clusters, as follows</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">curl -XGET tribe_node:9200/index1,index2/_search -u tribe_user:tribe_user</pre>
</div>
<p>requires <code class="literal">search</code> privileges for both <code class="literal">index1</code> and <code class="literal">index2</code> on the Tribe Node:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">tribe_user:
  indices:
    'index*': search</pre>
</div>
<p>Also, the same privileges need to be granted on the connected clusters, meaning that <code class="literal">cluster1</code> has to grant access to
<code class="literal">index2</code> even though <code class="literal">index2</code> only exists on <code class="literal">cluster2</code>; the same requirement applies for <code class="literal">index1</code> on <code class="literal">cluster2</code>. This
applies to any indices action. As for cluster state read operations (e.g. cluster state api, get mapping api etc.),
they always get executed locally on the Tribe Node, to make sure that the merged cluster state gets returned; their
privileges are then required on the Tribe Node only.</p>
<h3><a id="_same_system_key_on_all_clusters"></a>Same system key on all clusters<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack/edit/shield-1.0/docs/public/shield/appendices/05-tribe-node.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In order for <a class="xref" href="getting-started.html#message-authentication" title="Message Authentication">message authentication</a> to properly work across multiple clusters, the Tribe Node
and all of the connected clusters need to share the same system key.</p>
<h3><a id="_encrypted_communication"></a>Encrypted communication<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack/edit/shield-1.0/docs/public/shield/appendices/05-tribe-node.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Encrypted communication via SSL can only be enabled globally, meaning that either all of the connected clusters and the
Tribe Node have SSL enabled, or none of them have.</p>
<h3><a id="_same_certification_authority_on_all_clusters"></a>Same certification authority on all clusters<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack/edit/shield-1.0/docs/public/shield/appendices/05-tribe-node.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When using encrypted communication, for simplicity, we recommend all of the connected clusters and the Tribe Node use
the same certification authority to generate their certificates.</p>
<h3><a id="_example"></a>Example<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack/edit/shield-1.0/docs/public/shield/appendices/05-tribe-node.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s see a complete example on how to use the Tribe Node with shield and the configuration required. First of all the
Shield and License plugins need to be installed and enabled on all clusters and on the Tribe Node.</p>
<p>The system key needs to be generated on one node, as described in the <a class="xref" href="getting-started.html#message-authentication" title="Message Authentication">Getting Started section</a>,
and then copied over to all of the other nodes in each cluster and the Tribe Node itself.</p>
<p>Each cluster can have its own users with <code class="literal">admin</code> privileges that don&#8217;t need to be present in the Tribe Node too. In fact,
administration tasks (e.g. create index) cannot be performed through the Tribe Node but need to be sent directly to the
corresponding cluster. The users that need to be created on Tribe Node are those that allow to get back data merged from
the different clusters through the Tribe Node itself. Let&#8217;s for instance create as follows a <code class="literal">tribe_user</code> user, with
role <code class="literal">user</code>, that has <code class="literal">read</code> privileges on any index.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">./bin/shield/esusers useradd tribe_user -p tribe_user -r user</pre>
</div>
<p>The above command needs to be executed on each cluster, since the same user needs to be present on the Tribe Node as well
as on every connected cluster.</p>
<p>The following is the configuration required on the Tribe Node, that needs to be added to <code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code>.
Elasticsearch allows to list specific settings per cluster. We disable multicast discovery as described in the
<a class="xref" href="_configure_the_keystores_and_enable_ssl.html#disable-multicast" title="Disable multicast">Disable Multicast section</a> and configure the proper unicast discovery hosts for each cluster,
as well as their cluster names:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">tribe:
  t1:
    cluster.name: tribe1
    discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false
    discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["tribe1:9300"]
  t2:
    cluster.name: tribe2
    discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false
    discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["tribe2:9300"]</pre>
</div>
<p>The Tribe Node can then be started and once initialized it will be ready to accept requests like the following search,
which will return documents coming from the different connected clusters:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">curl -XGET localhost:9200/_search -u tribe_user:tribe_user</pre>
</div>
<p>As for encrypted communication, the required settings are the same as described in <a class="xref" href="securing-nodes.html" title="Securing Nodes">Securing Nodes</a>,
but need to be specified per tribe as we did for discovery settings above.</p>
