<p>This document discusses securing your Elasticsearch deployment, from initial installation to configuration.</p>
<h3><a id="_why_security"></a>Why Security?<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack/edit/shield-1.2/docs/public/shield/01-introduction.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>An Elasticsearch cluster benefits from properly implemented security in the following ways:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">

<a class="xref" href="authorization.html#roles" title="Roles, Permissions and Privileges">Role-based</a> access control at the index level and <a class="xref" href="ldap.html" title="LDAP Authentication">LDAP</a> authentication integration to <em>prevent

<h4><a id="_prevent_unauthorized_access"></a>Prevent Unauthorized Access<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack/edit/shield-1.2/docs/public/shield/01-introduction.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The term <em>unauthorized access</em> properly covers two distinct security concepts: <em>Authentication</em> and <em>Authorization</em>.
Authentication validates that a user is who they claim to be. A proper authentication setup enforces that only the
person named, for example, Kelsey Andorra can authenticate to Elasticsearch as the user <code class="literal">kandorra</code>. Shield ships with
out-of-the-box internal authentication mechanism and also integrates with LDAP and the Active Directory to provide
user authentication. Authorization enforces a set of privileges that are available to a specific user. To continue the
example, an authorization framework enforces that the user <code class="literal">kandorra</code> has the ability to perform specific actions on the
Elasticsearch cluster. These specific actions are called <em>privileges</em>. See the <a class="xref" href="reference.html" title="Appendix 8. Reference">Reference</a> section for a
complete list of privileges. Privileges are bundled into sets, and a set of privileges is called a <em>role</em>.
Shield also provides for authorization based on the client&#8217;s IP address. You may whitelist and blacklist subnets to
control network-level access to a server.</p>
<h4><a id="_preserve_data_integrity"></a>Preserve Data Integrity<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack/edit/shield-1.2/docs/public/shield/01-introduction.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>A standard Elasticsearch cluster provides functionality that provides redundancy to protect against <em>accidental</em> data
loss and corruption. By providing <a class="xref" href="ssl-tls.html" title="Encryption and Certificates"><em>encryption</em></a> for data that is being transmitted from node to node within
the cluster, Elasticsearch security protects data from <em>deliberate</em> tampering or unauthorized access.</p>
<h4><a id="_provides_an_audit_trail"></a>Provides an Audit Trail<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack/edit/shield-1.2/docs/public/shield/01-introduction.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Knowing who requested which actions on your data, and when, is an important part of security. Keeping an auditable log
of the activity in your cluster can not only help diagnose performance issues, but provide insight into attacks and
attempted breaches.</p>

<p>Security features for Elasticsearch are implemented in a plugin that you <a class="xref" href="getting-started.html" title="Getting Started (Long Version)">install</a> on each node in
your cluster.</p>
