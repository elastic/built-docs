<p>Shield introduces the concept of <em>action authorization</em> to Elasticsearch. Action authorization restricts the actions
users can execute on the cluster. Shield implements authorization as Role Based Access Control (RBAC), where all
actions are restricted by default. Users are associated with roles that define a set of actions that are allowed
for those users.</p>
<h3><a id="roles"></a>Roles, Permissions and Privileges<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack/edit/2.0/docs/public/shield/configuring-rbac.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Privileges are actions or a set of actions that users may execute in Elasticsearch. For example, the ability to run a
query is a privilege.</p>
<p>A permission is a set of privileges associated with one or more secured objects. For example, a permission could allow
querying or reading all documents of index <code class="literal">i1</code>.  There are two types of secured objects in Elasticsearch -
cluster and indices. Cluster permissions grant access to cluster-wide administrative and monitoring actions. Index
permissions grant data access, including administrative and monitoring actions on specific indices in the cluster.</p>
<p>A role is a named set of permissions. For example, you could define a role as a logging administrator. The logging
administrator is allowed to take all actions on indices named <code class="literal">logs-*</code>.</p>
<p>As an administrator, you will need to define the roles that you want to use, then assign users to the roles.</p>
