ERROR: extra arguments [&#8230;&#8203;] were provided

<dd>
<p>This error occurs when the esusers tool is parsing the input and finds unexepected arguments. This can happen when there
are special characters used in some of the arguments. For example, on Windows systems the <code class="literal">,</code> character is considered
a parameter separator; in other words <code class="literal">-r role1,role2</code> is translated to <code class="literal">-r role1 role2</code> and the <code class="literal">esusers</code> tool only recognizes
<code class="literal">role1</code> as an expected parameter. The solution here is to quote the parameter: <code class="literal">-r "role1,role2"</code>.</p>

Certain users are being frequently locked out of Active Directory
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Check your realm configuration; realms are checked serially, one after another. If your Active Directory realm is being checked before other realms and there are usernames
that appear in both Active Directory and another realm, a valid login for one realm may be causing failed login attempts in another realm.</p>
<p>For example, if <code class="literal">UserA</code> exists in both Active Directory and esusers, and the Active Directory realm is checked first and
esusers is checked second, an attempt to authenticate as <code class="literal">UserA</code> in the esusers realm would first attempt to authenticate
against Active Directory and fail, before successfully authenticating against the esusers realm. Because authentication is
verified on each request, the Active Directory realm would be checked - and fail - on each request for <code class="literal">UserA</code> in the esusers
realm. In this case, while the Shield request completed successfully, the account on Active Directory would have received
several failed login attempts, and that account may become temporarily locked out. Plan the order of your realms accordingly.</p>
<p>Also note that it is not typically necessary to define multiple Active Directory realms to handle domain controller failures. When using Microsoft DNS, the DNS entry for
the domain should always point to an available domain controller.</p>

<h4><a id="_sslhandshakeexception_causing_connections_to_fail"></a>SSLHandshakeException causing connections to fail<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack/edit/2.0/docs/public/shield/troubleshooting.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>A <code class="literal">SSLHandshakeException</code> will cause a connection to a node to fail and indicates that there is a configuration issue. Some of the
common exceptions are shown below with tips on how to resolve these issues.</p>
<div class="variablelist">

<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">java.security.cert.CertificateException: No name matching node01.example.com found</code>

</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates that a client connection was made to <code class="literal">node01.example.com</code> but the certificate returned did not contain the name <code class="literal">node01.example.com</code>.
In most cases, the issue can be resolved by ensuring the name is specified as a <code class="literal">SubjectAlternativeName</code> during <a class="xref" href="ssl-tls.html#private-key" title="Creating a Keystore and Generating a Certificate">certificate creation</a>.
Another scenario is when the environment does not wish to use DNS names in certificates at all. In this scenario, all settings
in <code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code> should only use IP addresses and the following setting needs to be set in <code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code>:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">shield.ssl.hostname_verification.resolve_name: false</pre>

</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates that a client connection was made to an IP address but the returned certificate did not contain any <code class="literal">SubjectAlternativeName</code> entries.
IP addresses are only used for hostname verification if they are specified as a <code class="literal">SubjectAlternativeName</code> during
<a class="xref" href="ssl-tls.html#private-key" title="Creating a Keystore and Generating a Certificate">certificate creation</a>. If the intent was to use IP addresses for hostname verification, then the certificate
will need to be regenerated. Also verify that <code class="literal">shield.ssl.hostname_verification.resolve_name: false</code> is <span class="strong strong"><strong>not</strong></span> set in
<code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code>.</p>

<p>The <code class="literal">SSLHandshakeException</code> above indicates that a self-signed certificate was returned by the client that is not trusted
as it cannot be found in the <code class="literal">truststore</code> or <code class="literal">keystore</code>. The <code class="literal">SSLException</code> above is seen on the client side of the connection.</p>

<dd>
<p>The <code class="literal">SunCertPathBuilderException</code> above indicates that a certificate was returned during the handshake that is not trusted.
This message is seen on the client side of the connection. The <code class="literal">SSLException</code> above is seen on the server side of the
connection. The CA certificate that signed the returned certificate was not found in the <code class="literal">keystore</code> or <code class="literal">truststore</code> and

ERROR: unsupported ciphers [&#8230;&#8203;] were requested but cannot be used in this JVM
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This error occurs when a SSL/TLS cipher suite is specified that cannot supported by the JVM that Elasticsearch is running
in. Shield will try to use the specified cipher suites that are supported by this JVM. This error can occur when using
the Shield defaults as some distributions of OpenJDK do not enable the PKCS11 provider by default. In this case, we
recommend consulting your JVM documentation for details on how to enable the PKCS11 provider.</p>
<p>Another common source of this error is requesting cipher suites that use encrypting with a key length greater than 128 bits
when running on an Oracle JDK. In this case, you will need to install the <a class="xref" href="ciphers.html" title="Enabling Cipher Suites for Stronger Encryption">JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files</a>.</p>
