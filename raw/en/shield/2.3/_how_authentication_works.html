supports the following types of realms:</p>

<p>The <em>native</em>, <em>file</em>, <em>LDAP</em>, and <em>Active Directory</em> realms authenticate using
the username and password authentication tokens.</p>
<p>Shield also supports custom realms. If you need to integrate with another
authentication system, you can build a custom realm plugin. For more information,
see <a class="xref" href="custom-realms.html" title="Integrating with Other Authentication Systems">Integrating with Other Authentication Systems</a>.</p>
<p>Realms live within a <em>realm chain</em>. It is essentially a prioritized list of
configured realms (typically of various types). The order of the list determines
the order in which the realms will be consulted. During the authentication
process, Shield will consult and try to authenticate the request one realm at a
time. Once one of the realms successfully authenticates the request, the
authentication is considered to be successful and the authenticated user will be
associated with the request (which will then proceed to the authorization phase).
If a realm cannot authenticate the request, the next in line realm in the chain
will be consulted. If all realms in the chain could not authenticate the request,
the authentication is then considered to be unsuccessful and an authentication
error will be returned (as HTTP status code <code class="literal">401</code>).</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Shield attempts to authenticate to each configured realm sequentially.
Some systems (e.g. Active Directory) have a temporary lock-out period after
several successive failed login attempts. If the same username exists in
multiple realms, unintentional account lockouts are possible. For more
information, please see <a class="xref" href="troubleshooting.html#trouble-shoot-active-directory" title="Active Directory">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For example, if <code class="literal">UserA</code> exists in both Active Directory and the file realm, and
the Active Directory realm is checked first and file is checked second, an
attempt to authenticate as <code class="literal">UserA</code> in the file realm would first attempt to
authenticate against Active Directory and fail, before successfully
authenticating against the file realm. Because authentication is verified on
each request, the Active Directory realm would be checked - and fail - on each
request for <code class="literal">UserA</code> in the file realm. In this case, while the Shield request
completed successfully, the account on Active Directory would have received
several failed login attempts, and that account may become temporarily locked
out. Plan the order of your realms accordingly.</p>
<p>The default realm chain contains the <code class="literal">native</code> and <code class="literal">file</code> realms. To explicitly,
configure a realm chain, you specify the chain in <code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code>. When you
configure a realm chain, only the realms you specify are used for authentication.
To use the <code class="literal">native</code> and <code class="literal">file</code> realms, you must include them in the chain.</p>
<p>The following snippet configures a realm chain that includes the <code class="literal">file</code> and
<code class="literal">native</code> realms, as well as two LDAP realms and an Active Directory realm.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">shield.authc:
    realms:
        native:
            type: native
            order: 0

        file:
            type: file
            order: 1

        ldap1:
            type: ldap

            enabled: false
            url: 'url_to_ldap1'

        ldap2:

</div>
<p>As can be seen above, each realm has a unique name that identifies it. There are
three settings that are common to all realms:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">type</code> (required) - Identifies the type of the ream (currently can be <code class="literal">native</code>,
<code class="literal">file</code>, <code class="literal">ldap</code>, <code class="literal">active_directory</code>, or <code class="literal">pki</code>). The realm type determines what
other settings the realms should be configured with.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">order</code> (optional) - Defines the priority/index of the realm within the realm
chain. This will determine when the realm will be consulted during
authentication, with lower order being consulted first.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">enabled</code> (optional) - When set to <code class="literal">false</code> the realm will be disabled and will
not be added to the realm chain. This is useful for debugging purposes, where
one can remove a realm from the chain without deleting and losing its
configuration.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The realm types can roughly be categorized to two categories:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">internal</code> - Internal realm types are realms that are internal to
Elasticsearch and don&#8217;t require any communication with external parties - they
are fully managed by Shield. There can only be a maximum of one configured realm
per internal realm type. (Currently, the internal realm types are <code class="literal">native</code> and
<code class="literal">file</code>).
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">external</code> - External realm types are realms that require interaction with
parties/components external to Elasticsearch, typically, with enterprise level
identity management systems. Unlike the <code class="literal">internal</code> realms, there can be as many
<code class="literal">external</code> realms as one would like - each with a unique name and different
settings. (Currently the only <code class="literal">external</code> realm types that exist are <code class="literal">ldap</code>,
<code class="literal">active_directory</code>, and <code class="literal">pki</code>).
</li>
