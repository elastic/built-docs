<p><em>Shield</em> is a plugin for Elasticsearch that enables you to easily secure a cluster. With Shield,
you can password-protect your data as well as implement more advanced security measures such as encrypting communications, role-based access control, IP filtering, and auditing. This guide
describes how to install Shield, configure the security features you need, and interact with your secured cluster.</p>

<h4><a id="preventing-unauthorized-access"></a>Preventing Unauthorized Access<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack/edit/2.3/docs/public/shield/introduction.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access to your Elasticsearch cluster, you must have a way to <em>authenticate</em> users. This simply means that you need a way to validate that a user is who they claim to be. For example, you have to make sure only the person named <em>Kelsey Andorra</em> can sign in as the user <code class="literal">kandorra</code>. Shield provides a standalone authentication mechanism that enables you to quickly <a class="xref" href="enable-basic-auth.html" title="Control Access with Basic Authentication">password-protect your cluster</a>. If you&#8217;re already using <a class="xref" href="ldap-realm.html" title="LDAP User Authentication">LDAP</a>, <a class="xref" href="active-directory-realm.html" title="Active Directory User Authentication">Active Directory</a>, or <a class="xref" href="pki-realm.html" title="PKI User Authentication">PKI</a>, Shield easily integrates with those systems to perform user authentication.</p>
<p>In many cases, simply authenticating users isn&#8217;t enough. You also need a way to control what data users have access to and what tasks they can perform. Shield enables you to <em>authorize</em> users by
assigning access <em>privileges</em> to a <em>role</em>, and assigning those roles to users. For example, this <a class="xref" href="configuring-rbac.html" title="Role-based Access Control">role-based access control</a> mechanism enables you to specify that the user <code class="literal">kandorra</code> can only perform read  operations on the <code class="literal">events</code> index and can&#8217;t do anything at all with other indices.</p>
<p>Shield also supports <a class="xref" href="ip-filtering.html" title="Using IP Filtering">IP-based authorization</a>. You can whitelist and blacklist specific IP addresses or subnets to control network-level access to a server.</p>

<p>A critical part of security is keeping confidential data confidential. Elasticsearch has built-in protections against accidental data loss and corruption. However, there&#8217;s nothing to stop deliberate tampering or data interception. Shield preserves the integrity of your data by <a class="xref" href="ssl-tls.html" title="Setting Up SSL/TLS on a Cluster">encrypting communications</a> to and from nodes and <a class="xref" href="enable-message-authentication.html" title="Enable Message Authentication">authenticating messages</a> to verify that they have not been tampered with or corrupted in transit during node-to-node communication. For even greater protection, you can increase the <a class="xref" href="ciphers.html" title="Enabling Cipher Suites for Stronger Encryption">encryption strength</a> and <a class="xref" href="separating-node-client-traffic.html" title="Separating node to node and client traffic">separate client traffic from node-to-node communications</a>.</p>

<p>Keeping a system secure takes vigilance. By using Shield to maintain an audit trail, you can easily see who is accessing your cluster and what they&#8217;re doing. By analyzing access patterns and failed attempts to access your cluster, you can gain insights into attempted attacks and data breaches. Keeping an auditable log of the activity in your cluster can also help diagnose operational issues.</p>
