<p>A <em>realm</em> is used to resolve and authenticate users and their roles. Shield
supports the following types of realms:</p>

<p>The <em>native</em>, <em>file</em>, <em>LDAP</em>, and <em>Active Directory</em> realms authenticate using the username and password authentication tokens.</p>
<p>Shield also supports custom realms. If you need to integrate with another authentication system, you
can build a custom realm plugin. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="custom-realms.html" title="Integrating with Other Authentication Systems">Integrating with Other
Authentication Systems</a>.</p>
<p>Realms live within a <em>realm chain</em>. It is essentially a prioritized list of configured realms (typically of various types).
The order of the list determines the order in which the realms will be consulted. During the authentication process,
Shield will consult and try to authenticate the request one realm at a time. Once one of the realms successfully
authenticates the request, the authentication is considered to be successful and the authenticated user will be associated
with the request (which will then proceed to the authorization phase). If a realm cannot authenticate the request, the
next in line realm in the chain will be consulted. If all realms in the chain could not authenticate the request, the
authentication is then considered to be unsuccessful and an authentication error will be returned (as HTTP status code <code class="literal">401</code>).</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Shield attempts to authenticate to each configured realm sequentially. Some systems (e.g. Active Directory) have a
temporary lock-out period after several successive failed login attempts. If the same username exists in multiple realms,
unintentional account lockouts are possible. For more information, please see <a class="xref" href="troubleshooting.html#trouble-shoot-active-directory" title="Active Directory">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For example, if <code class="literal">UserA</code> exists in both Active Directory and the file realm, and the Active Directory realm is checked first and
file is checked second, an attempt to authenticate as <code class="literal">UserA</code> in the file realm would first attempt to authenticate
against Active Directory and fail, before successfully authenticating against the file realm. Because authentication is
verified on each request, the Active Directory realm would be checked - and fail - on each request for <code class="literal">UserA</code> in the file
realm. In this case, while the Shield request completed successfully, the account on Active Directory would have received
several failed login attempts, and that account may become temporarily locked out. Plan the order of your realms accordingly.</p>
<p>The realm chain can be configured in the <code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code> file. When not explicitly configured, a default chain will be
created that holds the <code class="literal">native</code> and <code class="literal">file</code> realms in it. When explicitly configured, the created chain will be the exact reflection
of the configuration (e.g. the only realms in the chain will be those configured realms that are enabled)</p>
<p>The following snippet shows an example of realms configuration:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">shield.authc:
    realms:
        native:
            type: native
            order: 0

        file:
            type: file
            order: 1

        ldap1:
            type: ldap
            order: 2
            enabled: false
            url: 'url_to_ldap1'
            ...

        ldap2:
            type: ldap
            order: 3
            url: 'url_to_ldap2'
            ...

        ad1:
            type: active_directory
            order: 4
            url: 'url_to_ad'</pre>
</div>
<p>As can be seen above, each realm has a unique name that identifies it. There are three settings that are common to all
realms:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">type</code> (required) - Identifies the type of the ream (currently can be <code class="literal">native</code>,<code class="literal">file</code>, <code class="literal">ldap</code>, <code class="literal">active_directory</code>, or <code class="literal">pki</code>). The realm
type determines what other settings the realms should be configured with.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">order</code> (optional) - Defines the priority/index of the realm within the realm chain. This will determine when the realm
will be consulted during authentication, with lower order being consulted first.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">enabled</code> (optional) - When set to <code class="literal">false</code> the realm will be disabled and will not be added to the realm chain. This is
useful for debugging purposes, where one can remove a realm from the chain without deleting and
losing its configuration.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The realm types can roughly be categorized to two categories:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">internal</code> - Internal realm types are realms that are internal to Elasticsearch and don&#8217;t require any communication with
external parties - they are fully managed by Shield. There can only be a maximum of one configured realm
per internal realm type. (Currently, the internal realm types are <code class="literal">native</code> and <code class="literal">file</code>).
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">external</code> - External realm types are realms that require interaction with parties/components external to Elasticsearch,
typically, with enterprise level identity management systems. Unlike the <code class="literal">internal</code> realms, there can be
as many <code class="literal">external</code> realms as one would like - each with a unique name and different settings. (Currently
the only <code class="literal">external</code> realm types that exist are <code class="literal">ldap</code>, <code class="literal">active_directory</code>, and <code class="literal">pki</code>).
</li>
</ul>
