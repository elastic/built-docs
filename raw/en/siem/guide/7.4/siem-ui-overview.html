<p>This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.</p>

<p>After you have your SIEM data sources <a class="xref" href="install-siem.html" title="Get up and running">up and running</a> and
security events are streaming to Elasticsearch, check out the SIEM app in Kibana. You
can view and analyze security events, investigate previous threat detections, or
hunt for new potential security issues.</p>
<p>The SIEM app is a highly interactive workspace for security analysts. It is
designed to be discoverable, clickable, draggable and droppable, expandable and
collapsible, resizable, moveable, and so forth.</p>
<p>The <span class="strong strong"><strong><a href="/guide/en/kibana/7.4/kuery-query.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Kibana Query Language (KQL)</a></strong></span> bar is available
throughout the SIEM app for searching and filtering.</p>

<p>The default index patterns for SIEM events are <code class="literal">auditbeat-*</code>, <code class="literal">winlogbeat-*</code>,

<p>The Overview page provides a high-level view into security events available
for analysis, and can help surface problems with data ingestion.</p>
<p>Notice the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Timeline</strong></span> on the right of the SIEM UI. It is always available for
starting an investigation, whether in its collapsed or expanded state. Identify
items you want to dig into, and drag and drop them to the Timeline. Those items
are waiting for you when you are ready to start your investigation.</p>

<p>The Hosts view provides key metrics regarding host-related security
events, and a set of data tables that let you interact with the Timeline Event
Viewer. You can drag and drop items of interest from the Hosts view tables to
Timeline for further investigation.</p>

<p>The Network view provides key network activity metrics and an interactive map,
facilitates investigation time enrichment, and provides network event tables that
enable interaction with the Timeline. You can drag and drop items of interest from
the Network view to Timeline for further investigation.</p>

<h3><a id="map-ui"></a>Map<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.4/docs/en/siem/siem-ui.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The map provides a visual overview of your network traffic. It is interactive,
so you can start exploring data directly from the map. Hover over source and
destination points to see more information, such as hostnames and IP addresses.
To drill down, click a point and use the plus sign to add a field to the
query bar. You can also click a hostname to jump to the SIEM Host page, or
an IP address to open the relevant network details.</p>
<p>Just as you can start an investigation using the map, the map refreshes to show
relevant data when you run a query or update the time frame.</p>
<div class="tip admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>To add and remove layers, click on the more options icon in the top right
corner of the map.</p>

<p><a class="xref" href="conf-map-ui.html" title="Configuring map data">Configuring map data</a> describes how to add map data and set up interactions.</p>
<h3><a id="timelines-ui"></a>Timelines<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.4/docs/en/siem/siem-ui.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Use timelines as your workspace for alert investigations or threat hunting.
Data from multiple indices can be added to a timeline, which enables
investigating complex threats, such as lateral movement of malware across hosts
in your network.</p>
<p>You can drag objects of interest into the Timeline Event Viewer to create
exactly the query filter you need to get to the bottom of an alert. You can drag
items from table widgets within Hosts and Network pages, or even from within
Timeline itself.</p>
<p>A timeline is responsive and persists as you move through the SIEM app
collecting data. Auto-saving ensures that the results of your investigation are
available for review by other analysts and incident response teams.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="timeline-ui.png" alt="timeline ui">
</div>
</div>
<p>Add notes for your own use and to communicate your workflow and findings to
others. You can share a timeline, or pass it off to another person or team. You
can link to timelines from a ticketing system.</p>
<h4><a id="raw"></a>See raw event data<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.4/docs/en/siem/siem-ui.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Many security events in Timeline are presented in an easy-to-follow rendered
view, which enables quicker analyst understanding. You can click and expand
events from within Timeline to see the underlying event data, either in tabular
form, as as Elasticsearch JSON.</p>
<h4><a id="narrow-expand"></a>Narrow or expand your query<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.4/docs/en/siem/siem-ui.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>You can specify logical <code class="literal">AND</code> and <code class="literal">OR</code> operations with an item&#8217;s placement in
the drop area. Horizontal filters are <code class="literal">AND</code>-ed together. Vertical filters or
sets are <code class="literal">OR</code>-ed together. As you hover the item over the drop area, you can see
whether your placement is on target to create an <code class="literal">AND</code> or <code class="literal">OR</code> filters.</p>
<h4><a id="pivot"></a>Pivot on a data point<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.4/docs/en/siem/siem-ui.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Click a filter to access additional operations such as exclude, temporarily
disable, or delete items from the query. For example, you can change an included
item so that it is excluded.</p>
<h4><a id="row-renderer"></a>Get more context for each event<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.4/docs/en/siem/siem-ui.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>As you build and modify your queries, you can see the results of your
interactions in the details pane below.</p>
<p>As your query takes shape, an easy-to-follow rendered view appears for events. It
shows relevant contextual information that helps tell the backstory of the
event. If you see a particular item that interests you, you can drag it to the
drop area for further introspection.</p>
<h4><a id="other"></a>Other actions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.4/docs/en/siem/siem-ui.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>The Timeline is flexible and highly interactive.  As you would expect, the
SIEM app lets you:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
add, remove, reorder, or resize Timeline columns.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
save, open, and list Timelines
</li>
<li class="listitem">
add notes to individual events
</li>
<li class="listitem">
add investigation notes for the whole Timeline
</li>
<li class="listitem">
pin events to the Timeline for persistence
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Try clicking to expand or collapse items, or dragging and dropping them to other
areas to see what happens. Are there interactions that you would expect to see
that aren&#8217;t present?  Let us know. We welcome your input.</p>
