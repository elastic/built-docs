<p>With your Elastic subscription, you get access to support from the creators of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, Logstash, and much more. We&#8217;re here to help!</p>
<h3><a id="_how_do_i_open_a_support_case"></a>How do I open a support case?<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/tech-content/edit/8.15/welcome-to-elastic/get-support-help.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>There are three ways you can reach out to get support:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>From the Support Portal: <a href="http://support.elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">http://support.elastic.co</a>.</strong></span> The Elastic Support Portal is the central place where you can access all of your cases, subscriptions, and licenses. Within a few hours after subscribing, you receive an email with instructions on how to log in to the Support Portal, where you can track both current and archived cases.<br></p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If you just signed up for a trial, you do not get access to the Support Portal until you subscribe. Instead, you can ask for help using the other methods detailed in this document.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>From the Elastic Cloud Console.</strong></span> Go to the <a href="https://cloud.elastic.co/support?page=docs&amp;placement=docs-body" class="ulink" target="_top">Support page</a> or select the support icon, that looks like a life preserver, on any page in the console.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>By email: <a href="mailto:support@elastic.co" class="ulink" target="_top">support@elastic.co</a></strong></span>. If you contact us by email, please use the email address that you registered with, so that we can help you more quickly. If you are using a distribution list as your registered email, you can also register a second email address with us. Just open a case to let us know the name and email address you would like to be added.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When opening a case, there are a few things you can do to get help faster:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">

<h3><a id="_what_level_of_support_can_i_expect"></a>What level of support can I expect?<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/tech-content/edit/8.15/welcome-to-elastic/get-support-help.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Support is governed by the <a href="/legal/terms-of-service/cloud" class="ulink" target="_top">Elastic Cloud Standard Terms of Service</a>. The level of support you can expect to receive depends on your subscription level:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Standard subscriptions and active trials
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The main focus of support is to ensure your deployment shows a green status and is available. There is no guaranteed initial or ongoing response time, but we do strive to engage on every issue within three business days. We do not offer weekend coverage, so we respond Monday through Friday only. To learn more, check <a href="/support/welcome/cloud" class="ulink" target="_top">Working with Elastic Cloud Support</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Gold, Platinum and Enterprise subscriptions
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
These subscription levels provide guaranteed response times for support issues, better support coverage hours, and support contacts at Elastic. It also includes support for how-to and development questions. The exact support coverage depends on your subscription level. To learn more, check <a href="/legal/support_policy/cloud_premium" class="ulink" target="_top">Premium Support Services Policy</a>.
