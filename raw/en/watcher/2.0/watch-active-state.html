<p>By default, when you add a watch it is immediately set to the active state. An active watch is
registered with the relevant trigger engine and executed according to its configured trigger.
For example, if a watch has a <a class="xref" href="trigger.html#trigger-schedule" title="Schedule Trigger"><code class="literal">schedule</code></a> trigger, it is executed according
to its schedule.</p>
<p>A watch can also be set to the inactive state. An inactive watch is still registered with Watcher,
but it is not registered with a trigger engine and can never be triggered. When you add a watch,
you can use the <a class="xref" href="api-rest.html#api-rest-put-watch-active-state" title="Controlling Default Active State"><code class="literal">active</code></a> parameter to set its initial state
to inactive. You can deactivate an existing watch with the <a class="xref" href="api-rest.html#api-rest-deactivate-watch" title="Deactivate Watch API">Deactivate Watch API</a>.
To reactivate a watch, you use the <a class="xref" href="api-rest.html#api-rest-activate-watch" title="Activate Watch API">Activate Watch API</a>.</p>

<p>You can still use the <a class="xref" href="api-rest.html#api-rest-execute-watch" title="Execute Watch API">Execute Watch API</a> to force the execution
        of an inactive watch.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Deactivating watches is useful in a variety of situations. For example, if you have a watch that
monitors an external system and need to take the system down for maintenance, you can deactivate
the watch so doesn&#8217;t unnecessarily report a bunch of execution failures during the maintenance
window. You might also want to deactivate a watch rather than deleting it entirely in case you
might want to use it at some point in the future.</p>
