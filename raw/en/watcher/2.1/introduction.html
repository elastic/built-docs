<p><em>Watcher</em> is a plugin for Elasticsearch that provides alerting and notification based on changes
in your data. This guide describes how to install, manage, and use Watcher.</p>

<p>With simple REST APIs, Elasticsearch is a platform that encourages integration and automation for
a wide range of use-cases. Increasingly, these use-cases require taking action based on changes or
anomalies in the data. For example, you might want to:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Monitor social media as another way to detect failures in user-facing automated systems like ATMs
or ticketing systems. When the number of tweets and posts in an area exceeds a threshold of
significance, notify a service technician.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Monitor your infrastructure, tracking disk usage over time. Open a helpdesk ticket when any
servers are likely to run out of free space in the next few days.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Track network activity to detect malicious activity, and proactively change firewall
configuration to reject the malicious user.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Monitor Elasticsearch, and send immediate notification to the system administrator if nodes leave
the cluster or query throughput exceeds an expected range.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Track application response times and if page-load time exceeds SLAs for more than 5 minutes, open
a helpdesk ticket. If SLAs are exceeded for an hour, page the administrator on duty.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>All of these use-cases share a few key properties:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The relevant data or changes in data can be identified with a periodic Elasticsearch query.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The results of the query can be checked against a condition.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
One or more actions are taken if the condition is true&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;an email is sent, a 3rd party system is
notified, or the query results are stored.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2><a id="_watcher_concepts"></a>Watcher Concepts<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack/edit/2.1/docs/public/watcher/introduction.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>Watcher provides an API for creating, managing and testing <em>watches</em>. A watch describes a single
alert in Watcher, which can contain multiple notification actions.</p>
<p>At a high-level, a typical watch is built from four simple building blocks:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
schedule
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Define the schedule on which to trigger the query and check the condition.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Query
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Specify the query to run as input to the condition. Watcher supports the full
Elasticsearch query language, including aggregations.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Condition
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Define your condition to determine whether to execute the actions. You can use simple
conditions (always true), or use scripting for more sophisticated scenarios.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Actions
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Define one or more actions, such as sending email, pushing data to 3rd party systems
via webhook, or indexing the results of your query.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>A full history of all watches is maintained in an Elasticsearch index. This history keeps track of
each time a watch is triggered and records the results from the query, whether the condition was
met, and what actions were taken.</p>
