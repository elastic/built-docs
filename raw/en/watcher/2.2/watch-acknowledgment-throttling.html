<p>Watcher supports both time-based and acknowledgment-based throttling. This enables you to prevent
actions from being repeatedly executed for the same event.</p>
<p>By default, Watcher uses time-based throttling with a throttle period of 5 seconds. This means that
if a watch is executed every second, its actions are performed a maximum of once every 5 seconds,
even when the condition is met. You can configure the throttle period on a per-action basis, at the
watch level, or  change the  <a class="xref" href="configuring-default-throttle-period.html" title="Configuring the Default Throttle Period">default throttle period</a> in
<code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code>.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment-based throttling enables you to tell Watcher not to send any more notifications
about a watch as long as its condition remains true. Once the condition evaluates to <code class="literal">false</code>, the
acknowledgment is cleared and Watcher resumes executing the watch&#8217;s actions normally.</p>
