<p>With all these useful collaboration applications and services generating data, it&#8217;s a challenge to keep things organized. You have important files and pressing issues scattered all over the place. Workplace Search helps you find them, organize them, and take action on them.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>This is the Searcher&#8217;s Guide:</strong></span> it is designed to help you use all the tools at your disposal for efficient information hunting across all available content sources. It focuses on the web-based search experience provided with Workplace Search, but your organization may provide a different search integration. In any case, most principles here should apply.</p>

<p>You have met many search bars. Google has one, as does Bing, Yahoo – and most popular websites and applications. This one is like those, but with one key difference: it doesn&#8217;t search <em>one thing</em> – it searches many different things: <span class="strong strong"><strong>your</strong></span> things.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>It&#8217;s one search bar for your everyday work life. And it understands your natural language.</strong></span></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to type strange incantations. You can phrase your search as if you were speaking to another person:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
"monthly accounting report in <span class="strong strong"><strong>Google Drive</strong></span>".
</li>
<li class="listitem">
"bugs assigned to <span class="strong strong"><strong>John</strong></span> in <span class="strong strong"><strong>GitHub</strong></span> with status <span class="strong strong"><strong>blocked</strong></span>."
</li>
<li class="listitem">
"team sync in <span class="strong strong"><strong>Dropbox</strong></span> updated <span class="strong strong"><strong>Yesterday</strong></span>"
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>When you hit on a key phrase, the text will turn blue and the parameters of your search will be toggled and filtered against automatically.</strong></span></p>

<p>The main dashboard shows you what&#8217;s new and the content sources through which you can search. Recently updated content or files will appear under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Recent Activity</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Upon a succesful query, you can manually supplement keyword-based searches by setting the <span class="strong strong"><strong>time</strong></span> and <span class="strong strong"><strong>relevancy</strong></span>. Unless you specify a time frame using natural language, the default is <span class="strong strong"><strong>All Time</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Click the clock to set your own custom time frame:</p>
<div id="manual-time-frame" class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/workplace-search-timeframe.png" alt="It&#8217;s the search UI. A search for product is present, and there are some results. The time dropdown is invoked and you can select yesterday, last week, last month, or a custom frame.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 117. Choosing a timeframe for a query</div>
</div>
<p>Click <span class="strong strong"><strong>Relevance</strong></span> to change between search modes. You can sort by Relevance or Recently Updated:</p>
<div id="manual-relevance" class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/workplace-search-sort.png" alt="The Relevance dropdown menu next to the searchbar. The Recently Updated option is invoked and the results have shifted accordingly with the most recent at the top.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 118. Relevance or Recently Updated</div>
</div>
<p>After a query has been performed, you can toggle filters on and off. This means you can add or remove sources from the search, change the content type, item status, and more:</p>
<div id="manual-fully-faceted" class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/manual-filtering.png" alt="A long list of facets. It uses GitHub as an example. Shows " width="type"" height="where pull request is selected">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 119. Filtering with Workplace Search</div>
</div>
<p>Each time you add a filter, your results will reflect your choices. Use filters to narrow down searches as much as you&#8217;d like. Note that each filter value can be included in a natural query.</p>
<p>So you could write: "<span class="strong strong"><strong>open</strong></span> fancy project <span class="strong strong"><strong>pull requests</strong></span>" as a query. The filters would then be applied automatically. With these tricks, you&#8217;ll be able to keep narrowing things down to find just what you&#8217;re seeking.</p>

<p>Your administrator has added a number of sources through which you can search at the organization level, <span class="strong strong"><strong>but you may also add your own</strong></span>. Each individual can add their own <span class="strong strong"><strong>Private Sources</strong></span>. You might add your own private GitHub source or private Google Drive, for example. When you add a private source, its content will only be available to you. That way, you can supplement your organization&#8217;s information with your own things.</p>
