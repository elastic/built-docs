<p>Each content source has indexing rules that determine what data is synchronized to Workplace Search.
Each content source also has an indexing schedule that determines when data is synchronized to Workplace Search.
Both the indexing rules and synchronization schedule can be configured individually for any

<p>If you create or update indexing rules for an existing content source, the new rules may exclude documents that have already been indexed.

<p>Indexing rules can be configured for each content source.
You may be able to use custom indexing rules to speed up content source synchronization and decrease storage costs.
You can also exclude content that shouldn&#8217;t be processed, such as binary files.</p>
<p>Indexing rules apply at the time of full source synchronization.
This means that they will only take effect when the content from a source is re-synchronized.
Changing indexing rules automatically triggers a synchronization process, but this process might take some time, especially when dealing with content sources that have large sets of documents.</p>
<p>Indexing rules are evaluated in order. Any object is evaluated against each rule in order, and the first rule it matches will be applied to it. This means that if the first rule excludes a file, that file will be excluded from indexing even if later rules include it. Similarly, if the first rule includes a file that file will be included even if later rules exclude it.</p>
<p>In this guide, you will see how to change the indexing rules on a content source.
Here are some examples of sources that support custom indexing rules:</p>

<h5><a id="updating-indexing-rules"></a>Modify the indexing rules on a content source<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/main/workplace-search-docs/guides/content-sources/customizing-indexing.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>These steps assume you have already <a class="xref" href="workplace-search-content-sources.html" title="Content Sources Overview">connected a source</a>. Here we will modify the indexing rules on a Dropbox source to exclude content from a top-level folder named <em>Legal</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Step 1.</strong></span> First, we need to locate the content source in Kibana, and open the Assets and objects page. From the administrative dashboard, navigate to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Sources</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/es-admin-custom-sources-menu.png" alt="A picture of the sidebar within the administrative dashboard. The item " width="sources" is illuminated."">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 123. Content sources</div>
</div>
<p>From here, open the Dropbox content source by clicking on <em>Details</em>, then click on <span class="strong strong"><strong>Synchronization</strong></span> in the sidebar and open the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Assets and objects</strong></span> page.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Step 2.</strong></span> Next, we need to identify the filter rule we wish to use when indexing documents. If we assume our Dropbox documents exist at the following paths:</p>
<pre class="screen">/employee-directory.pdf
/Documentation/enabling-saml-auth.pdf
/Documentation/customizing-content-sources.pdf
/Legal/clients-list.xls
/Legal/Contracts/business.docx</pre>
<p>If we want to exclude <em>every</em> document contained in the top-level <em>Legal</em> folder, we can use a pattern like:</p>
<pre class="screen">/Legal/**/*</pre>
<p>This pattern is created using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glob patterns</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Step 3.</strong></span> We can then use the table at the bottom of the page to build an indexing configuration to filter out our <em>Legal</em> documents. Click <em>Add indexing rule</em>, set the <em>Policy</em> to <em>Exclude</em>, the <em>Rule</em> to <em>Path</em> and the Value to <em>/Legal/**/*</em>. Click <em>Save</em> in the table to add the rule to the indexing configuration.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/guides/content-sources/indexing-rule-exclude-legal.png" alt="A picture of the Assets and objects page. A rule to exclude all documents in the Legal path has been added.">
</div>
</div>
<p>Note that the new indexing rule configuration won&#8217;t be saved until you click the <em>Save</em> button at the top of the page. You can do so now.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Disabling <code class="literal">Sync thumbnails</code> and <code class="literal">Sync full-text from files</code> prevents future syncing of these assets, but it does not remove previously synced assets.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Step 4.</strong></span> Modifying a content source&#8217;s indexing configuration will trigger a full synchronization of the source&#8217;s data. When complete, we should see that no documents from the top-level <em>Legal</em> folder were indexed into Workplace Search.</p>
<h5><a id="additional-indexing-rules-examples"></a>Additional examples<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-pubs/edit/main/workplace-search-docs/guides/content-sources/customizing-indexing.asciidoc">edit</a></h5>
<p>Using the above steps, here are some additional examples of indexing configurations for other use cases.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Revert indexing configuration to default</strong></span></p>
<p>To revert a source&#8217;s indexing configuration back to the default state, you can remove all rules. The default rule will always stay in place, as all files that don&#8217;t fit a rule are automatically included in indexing.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Include only specific sub-directories</strong></span></p>
<p>For file system based sources, rather than excluding content, perhaps you only want to index content within a specific set of directories. Note that rules are evaluated in order, which allows a complex mixture of <code class="literal">include</code> and <code class="literal">exclude</code> rules. This example will index all content in the <em>Engineering</em> and <em>Design</em> top-level folders, however the <em>Templates</em> folder within <em>Design</em> will also be excluded:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/guides/content-sources/indexing-rule-indexing-order.png" alt="A picture of the Assets and objects page. Three rules have been added, the first excludes everything in the /Design/Templates folder, the second includes everything in /Engineering, the third includes everything in /Design.">
</div>
</div>
<p>Rules can easily be reordered by dragging them within the table. You will need to click <em>Save</em> at the top of the page to store your changes and trigger a full synchronization.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Exclude specific file extensions</strong></span></p>
<p>This configuration will exclude some common executable file types:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/guides/content-sources/indexing-rule-exclude-files.png" alt="A picture of the Assets and objects page. Three rules have been added, excluding exe, bat and sh files.">
</div>
</div>
<hr>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Exclude specific object types</strong></span></p>
<p>This configuration will exclude some specific object types. Which object types you can exclude or include will depend on your content source. This is particularly useful for content sources that sync in a variety of document types, like Salesforce:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/guides/content-sources/indexing-rule-exclude-object-types.png" alt="A picture of the Assets and objects page. Two rules have been added to exclude Opportunity and Attachment file types.">

<p>The schedule that determines when data is synchronized to Workplace Search can be configured for each content source.
You can configure a schedule that synchronizes less frequently, to lower the burden on a third-party server, or
you can synchronize more frequently to ensure your data is up-to-date.
You can also configure windows of time when synchronization should not be performed. This can allow you to perform
operations such as scheduled maintenance in a third-party system that Workplace Search connects to.</p>

<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Full sync</strong></span> (<em>runs every 72 hours by default</em>): This synchronization job synchronizes all of the data from the content source ensuring full data parity.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Incremental sync</strong></span> (<em>runs every 2 hours by default</em>): This synchronization job synchronizes updates to the data at the content source ensuring high data freshness.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Deletion sync</strong></span> (<em>runs every 6 hours by default</em>): This synchronization job synchronizes document deletions from the content source ensuring regular removal of stale data.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Permissions sync</strong></span> (<em>runs every 5 minutes by default, when <a class="xref" href="workplace-search-sources-document-permissions.html" title="Managing document access &amp; permissions for content sources">Document Level Permissions</a> are enabled</em>): This synchronization job synchronizes document permissions from the content sources ensuring secure access to documents on Workplace Search.</p>
<p>Only one sync job of a given type for a given content source can run at a time.  For example, if a Salesforce content source
takes longer than the default of 3 days to run, Workplace Search will not spawn another full sync job for Salesforce until
the existing full sync has completed.</p>
<p>Each sync job type for a given content source can run independently.  For example, if a full sync job is in progress for
Salesforce, an incremental sync can run at the same time as the full sync.  This allows us to prioritize recently updated data
while still allowing older data to be synced.</p>
