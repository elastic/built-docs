<p>The Graph API can explore multiple indices, types, or aliases in a
single API request, but the assumption is that each "hop" it performs
is querying the same set of indices. Currently, it is not possible to
take a term found in a field from one index and use that value to explore
connections in <em>a different field</em> held in another type or index.</p>
<p>A good example of where this might be useful is if an IP address is
found in the <code class="literal">remote_host</code> field of an index called "weblogs20160101",
you might want to follow that up by looking for the same address in
the <code class="literal">ip_address</code> field of an index called "knownthreats".</p>
<p>Supporting this behaviour would require extra mappings to indicate that
the weblogs' <code class="literal">remote_host</code> field contained values that had currency and
meaning in the <code class="literal">ip_address</code> field of the threats index.</p>
<p>Since we do not currently support this translation, you would have to
perform multiple calls to take the values from the weblogs index
response and build them into a separate request to the threats index.</p>
