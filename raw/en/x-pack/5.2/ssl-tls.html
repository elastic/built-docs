<p>X-Pack security enables you to encrypt traffic to, from and within your Elasticsearch
cluster. Connections are secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS), which is
commonly referred to as "SSL".</p>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Clusters that do not have encryption enabled send all data in plain text
including passwords.</p>

<p>To enable encryption, you need to perform the following steps on each node in
the cluster:</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>TLS requires X.509 certificates to perform encryption and authentication of the application
that is being communicated with. In order for the communication between nodes to be truly
secure, the certificates must be validated. The recommended approach for validating
certificate authenticity in a Elasticsearch cluster is to trust the certificate authority (CA)
that signed the certificate. By doing this, as nodes are added to your cluster they just need
to use a certificate signed by the same CA and the node is automatically allowed to join the
cluster. Additionally, it is recommended that the certificates contain subject alternative
names (SAN) that correspond to the node&#8217;s ip address and dns name so that hostname verification
can be performed.</p>
<p>In order to simplify the process of generating certificates for the Elastic Stack, a command
line tool, <code class="literal">certgen</code> has been included with X-Pack. This tool takes care of the generating
a CA and signing certificates with the CA. <code class="literal">certgen</code> can be used interactively or in a silent
mode through the use of an input file. The <code class="literal">certgen</code> tool also supports generation of certificate
signing requests (CSR), so that a commercial or organization specific CA may be used to sign
the certificates.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If you choose not to use the <code class="literal">certgen</code>, the certificates that you obtain must allow for both
<code class="literal">clientAuth</code> and <code class="literal">serverAuth</code> if the extended key usage extension is present. The certificates
need to be in PEM format. Although not required, it is highly recommended that the certificate contain
the dns name(s) and/or ip address(es) of the node so that hostname verification may be used.</p>

<p>The <code class="literal">certgen</code> tool can be used to generate a CA and signed certificates for your nodes. The tool
can be used interactively:</p>
<pre class="screen">bin/x-pack/certgen
This tool assists you in the generation of X.509 certificates and certificate
signing requests for use with SSL in the Elastic stack. Depending on the command
line option specified, you may be prompted for the following:

* The path to the output file
    * The output file is a zip file containing the signed certificates and
      private keys for each instance. If a Certificate Authority was generated,
      the certificate and private key will also be included in the output file.
* Information about each instance
    * An instance is any piece of the Elastic Stack that requires a SSL certificate.
      Depending on your configuration, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Beats
      may all require a certificate and private key.
    * The minimum required value for each instance is a name. This can simply be the
      hostname, which will be used as the Common Name of the certificate. A full
      distinguished name may also be used.
    * IP addresses and DNS names are optional. Multiple values can be specified as a
      comma separated string. If no IP addresses or DNS names are provided, you may
      disable hostname verification in your SSL configuration.
* Certificate Authority private key password
    * The password may be left empty if desired.

Let's get started...

Please enter the desired output file [/home/es/config/x-pack/certificate-bundle.zip]:
Enter instance name: node01
Enter name for directories and files [node01]:
Enter IP Addresses for instance (comma-separated if more than one) []: 10.10.0.1
Enter DNS names for instance (comma-separated if more than one) []: node01.mydomain.com,node01
Would you like to specify another instance? Press 'y' to continue entering instance information: y
Enter instance name: node02
Enter name for directories and files [node02]:
Enter IP Addresses for instance (comma-separated if more than one) []: 10.10.0.2
Enter DNS names for instance (comma-separated if more than one) []: node02.mydomain.com
Would you like to specify another instance? Press 'y' to continue entering instance information:
Certificates written to /Users/jmodi/dev/tmp/elasticsearch-5.0.0-alpha5-SNAPSHOT/config/x-pack/certificate-bundle.zip

This file should be properly secured as it contains the private keys for all
instances and the certificate authority.

After unzipping the file, there will be a directory for each instance containing
the certificate and private key. Copy the certificate, key, and CA certificate
to the configuration directory of the Elastic product that they will be used for
and follow the SSL configuration instructions in the product guide.

For client applications, you may only need to copy the CA certificate and
configure the client to trust this certificate.</pre>
<p>The usage of <code class="literal">certgen</code> above generates a zip file with the CA certificate, private key, two signed certificates and keys
in PEM format for <code class="literal">node01</code> and <code class="literal">node02</code>.</p>
