<p>Prior to 5.0 all watcher specific settings were prefixed with <code class="literal">watcher</code>. Those
have been changed to start with <code class="literal">xpack.watcher</code> now, For example
<code class="literal">watcher.execution.default_throttle_period</code> becomes
<code class="literal">xpack.watcher.execution.default_throttle_period</code>.</p>
<p>The setting to allow scripting only for watcher has been renamed from
<code class="literal">script.engine.groovy.inline.elasticsearch-watcher_watch</code> to
<code class="literal">script.engine.groovy.inline.xpack_watch</code>.</p>
<p>All account specific SMTP timeouts (<code class="literal">smtp.timeout</code>, <code class="literal">smtp.connection_timeout</code> and
<code class="literal">smtp.write_timeout</code>) now require a time value instead of a number, that
represented milliseconds in earlier releases.</p>
<p>Watcher history now uses a versioned template. The index names also changed and
contain this version. So instead of <code class="literal">.watch_history_2016.02.03</code> the new index
name is <code class="literal">.watcher-history-1-2016.02.03</code>, <code class="literal">1</code> being the current version. If are
also migrating from Shield (to X-Pack security).</p>
<div class="important admon">

<div class="admon_content">
<p>this might require you to change roles/permissions because of the
            different index names!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The old index template named <code class="literal">watch_history</code> can be deleted now. It will not
interfere with the newly added index template though.</p>
<p>The notification settings for pagerduty, slack, hipchat and email have been moved and renamed. The move
happened from <code class="literal">xpack.watcher.actions</code> to <code class="literal">xpack.notification</code>.
For example the slack configuration needs to move from <code class="literal">xpack.watcher.actions.slack.service</code>
to <code class="literal">xpack.notification.slack</code>. The <code class="literal">service</code> part has been removed for all notification settings.</p>
<p>All watcher endpoints have been renamed from <code class="literal">/_watcher/XYZ</code> to <code class="literal">/_xpack/watcher/XYZ</code>.
You might need to fix this in your clients, monitoring scripts, potential HTTP proxies/redirectors
as well as in your watches.</p>

<p>The default scripting language in Elasticsearch has been changed to be painless. This applies for Watcher too, so
when new scripts or updating existing scripts and no script language has been explicitly specified then the painless
language will be used.</p>
<p>If in your watches you have scripts that don&#8217;t set the scripting language specifically then upon upgrading watcher
will set the language explicitly. By default the language will be set to groovy. If you your default language for scripts
is different than groovy then set the <code class="literal">script.legacy.default_lang</code> setting before upgrading to what your default language
is now.  This is important otherwise watches may not work after the upgrade and you need to update all your watches manually.</p>
