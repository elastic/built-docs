<p>An Elasticsearch cluster is typically made out of many moving parts. There are
the Elasticsearch nodes that form the cluster, and often Logstash instances,
Kibana instances, Beats agents an clients, all communicating with the it.
It should not come as a surprise that securing such clusters has many facets and
layers.</p>
<p>X-Pack security provides the means to secure the Elastic cluster on several levels:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">

</li>
<li class="listitem">
Authorization and Role Based Access Control (a.k.a RBAC)

<h3><a id="_user_authentication"></a>User Authentication<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/edit/5.6/docs/en/security/how-security-works.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>User authentication is the process of identifying the users behind the requests
that hit the cluster and verifying that indeed they are who they claim to be. The
authentication process is handled by one or more authentication services called
<em>realms</em>. X-Pack security provides the following built-in realms:</p>

<p>If none of the built-in realms meets your needs, you can also build your own
custom realm and plug it into X-Pack.</p>
<p>When X-Pack security is enabled, depending on the realms you&#8217;ve configured, you will
need to attach your user credentials to the requests sent to Elasticsearch. For
example, when using realms that support usernames and passwords you can simply
attach <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication" class="ulink" target="_top">basic auth</a> header to the requests.</p>

<h3><a id="_authorization"></a>Authorization<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/edit/5.6/docs/en/security/how-security-works.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The authorization process takes place once a request is authenticated and the
User behind the request is identified. Authorization is the process of determining
whether the user behind an incoming request is allowed to execute it. Naturally,
this process takes place right after an successful authentication - when the
user identity is known.</p>
<p>The authorization process revolves around the following 5 constructs:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>Secured Resource</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A resource to which access is restricted. Indices/aliases, documents, fields,
users and the Elasticsearch cluster itself are all examples of secured objects.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>Privilege</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A named group representing one or more actions that a user may execute against a
secured resource. Each secured resource has its own sets of available privileges.
For example, <code class="literal">read</code> is an index privilege that represents all actions that enable
reading the indexed/stored data. For a complete list of available privileges
see <a class="xref" href="security-privileges.html" title="Security Privileges">Security Privileges</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>Permissions</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
A set of one or more privileges against a secured resource. Permissions can
easily be described in words, here are few examples:
</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">read</code> privilege on the <code class="literal">products</code> index
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">manage</code> privilege on the cluster
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">run_as</code> privilege on <code class="literal">john</code> user
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">read</code> privilege on documents that match query X
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">read</code> privilege on <code class="literal">credit_card</code> field
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>Role</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A named sets of permissions
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>User</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
The authenticated user.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>A secure Elasticsearch cluster manages the privileges of users through <em>roles</em>.
A role has a unique name and identifies a set of permissions that translate to
privileges on resources. A user can be associated with an arbitrary number of
roles. The total set of permissions that a user has is therefore defined by
union of the permissions in all its roles.</p>
<p>Roles can be assigned to users in a number of ways depending on the realms by
which the users are authenticated.</p>
<p>For more information on user authentication see <a class="xref" href="authorization.html" title="Configuring Role-based Access Control"><em>Configuring Role-based Access Control</em></a></p>
<h3><a id="_nodeclient_authentication_and_channel_encryption"></a>Node/Client Authentication and Channel Encryption<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/edit/5.6/docs/en/security/how-security-works.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>X-Pack security supports configuring SSL/TLS for securing the communication channels
to, from and within the cluster. This support accounts for:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Encryption of data transmitted over the wires
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Certificate based node authentication - preventing unauthorized nodes/clients
from establishing a connection with the cluster.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For more information, see <a class="xref" href="encrypting-communications.html" title="Encrypting Communications">Encrypting Communications</a>.</p>
<p>X-Pack security also enables you to <a class="xref" href="ip-filtering.html" title="Restricting Connections with IP Filtering">configure IP Filters</a> which can
be seen as a light mechanism for node/client authentication. With IP Filtering
you can restrict the nodes and clients that can connect to the cluster based
on their IP addresses. The IP filters configuration provides whitelisting
and blacklisting of IPs, subnets and DNS domains.</p>
<h3><a id="_auditing"></a>Auditing<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/edit/5.6/docs/en/security/how-security-works.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>When dealing with any secure system, it is critical to have a audit trail
mechanism set in place. Audit trails log various activities/events that occur in
the system, enabling you to analyze and back track past events when things go
wrong (e.g. security breach).</p>
<p>X-Pack security provides such audit trail functionality for all nodes in the cluster.
You can configure the audit level which accounts for the type of events that are
logged. These events include failed authentication attempts, user access denied,
node connection denied, and more.</p>
<p>For more information on auditing see <a class="xref" href="auditing.html" title="Auditing Security Events"><em>Auditing Security Events</em></a>.</p>
