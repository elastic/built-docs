<p>Authentication in X-Pack security is handled by one or more authentication services
called <em>realms</em>. A <em>realm</em> is used to resolve and authenticate users based on
authentication tokens. X-Pack security provides the following built-in realms:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>native</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
An internal realm where users are stored in a dedicated Elasticsearch index.
This realm supports an authentication token in the form of username and password,
and is available by default when no realms are explicitly configured. See
<a class="xref" href="native-realm.html" title="Native User Authentication">Native User Authentication</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>ldap</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A realm that uses an external LDAP server to authenticate the
users. This realm supports an authentication token in the form of username and
password, and requires explicit configuration in order to be used. See
<a class="xref" href="ldap-realm.html" title="LDAP User Authentication">LDAP User Authentication</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>active_directory</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A realm that uses an external Active Directory Server to authenticate the
users. With this realm, users are authenticated by usernames and passwords.
See <a class="xref" href="active-directory-realm.html" title="Active Directory User Authentication">Active Directory User Authentication</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>pki</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
A realm that authenticates users using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This
realm works in conjunction with SSL/TLS and identifies the users through the
Distinguished Name (DN) of the client&#8217;s X.509 certificates. See <a class="xref" href="pki-realm.html" title="PKI User Authentication">PKI User Authentication</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<em>file</em>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
An internal realm where users are defined in files stored on each node in the
Elasticsearch cluster. This realm supports an authentication token in the form
of username and password, and is always available. See <a class="xref" href="file-realm.html" title="File-based User Authentication">File-based User Authentication</a>.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>X-Pack security also supports custom realms. If you need to integrate with another
authentication system, you can build a custom realm plugin. For more information,
see <a class="xref" href="custom-realms.html" title="Integrating with Other Authentication Systems">Integrating with Other Authentication Systems</a>.</p>
<p>Realms live within a <em>realm chain</em>. It is essentially a prioritized list of
configured realms (typically of various types). The order of the list determines
the order in which the realms will be consulted. During the authentication process,
X-Pack security will consult and try to authenticate the request one realm at a time.
Once one of the realms successfully authenticates the request, the authentication
is considered to be successful and the authenticated user will be associated
with the request (which will then proceed to the authorization phase). If a realm
cannot authenticate the request, the next in line realm in the chain will be
consulted. If all realms in the chain could not authenticate the request, the
authentication is then considered to be unsuccessful and an authentication error
will be returned (as HTTP status code <code class="literal">401</code>).</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Some systems (e.g. Active Directory) have a temporary lock-out period after
      several successive failed login attempts. If the same username exists in
      multiple realms, unintentional account lockouts are possible. For more
      information, please see <a class="xref" href="trouble-shoot-active-directory.html" title="Users are frequently locked out of Active Directory">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The default realm chain contains the <code class="literal">native</code> and <code class="literal">file</code> realms. To explicitly,
configure a realm chain, you specify the chain in <code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code>. When you
configure a realm chain, only the realms you specify are used for authentication.
To use the <code class="literal">native</code> and <code class="literal">file</code> realms, you must include them in the chain.</p>
<p>The following snippet configures a realm chain that includes the <code class="literal">file</code> and
<code class="literal">native</code> realms, as well as two LDAP realms and an Active Directory realm.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">xpack.security.authc:
  realms:

    file:
      type: file
      order: 0

    native:
      type: native
      order: 1

    ldap1:
      type: ldap
      order: 2
      enabled: false
      url: 'url_to_ldap1'
      ...

    ldap2:
      type: ldap
      order: 3
      url: 'url_to_ldap2'
      ...

    ad1:
      type: active_directory
      order: 4
      url: 'url_to_ad'</pre>
</div>
<p>As can be seen above, each realm has a unique name that identifies it and each
realm type dictates its own set of required and optional settings. That said,
there are three settings that are common to all realms:</p>
<div class="informaltable">
<table border="1" cellpadding="4px">
<colgroup>
<col class="col_1"/>
<col class="col_2"/>
<col class="col_3"/>
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left" valign="top">Setting</th>
<th align="center" valign="top">Required</th>
<th align="left" valign="top">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p><code class="literal">type</code></p></td>
<td align="center" valign="top"><p>true</p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p>Identifies the type of the realm. The realm type
                            determines what other settings the realms should be
                            configured with. The type can be one of: <code class="literal">native</code>,
                            <code class="literal">ldap</code>, <code class="literal">active_directory</code>, <code class="literal">pki</code>, <code class="literal">file</code>, or in case
                            of a custom realm, the type name that identifies it.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p><code class="literal">order</code></p></td>
<td align="center" valign="top"><p>false</p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p>A numeric value representing the priority/index of
                            the realm within the realm chain. This will determine
                            the order by which the realms will be consulted
                            during authentication, with lower order being consulted
                            first.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p><code class="literal">enabled</code></p></td>
<td align="center" valign="top"><p>false</p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top"><p>When set to <code class="literal">false</code> the realm will be disabled and
                            will not be added to the realm chain. This is useful
                            for debugging purposes as it enables you to remove
                            a realm from the chain without deleting and losing
                            its configuration.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Realm types can roughly be classified in two categories:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl class="variablelist">
<dt>
<span class="term">
Internal
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Realms that are internal to Elasticsearch and don&#8217;t require any
communication with external parties. They are fully managed by
X-Pack security. There can only be a maximum of one configured realm
per internal realm type. X-Pack security provides two internal realm
types: <code class="literal">native</code> and <code class="literal">file</code>.
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
External
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
Realms that require interaction with parties/components external to
Elasticsearch, typically, with enterprise grade identity management
systems. Unlike internal realms, there can be as many external realms
as one would like - each with its own unique name and configuration.
X-Pack security provides three external realm types: <code class="literal">ldap</code>,
<code class="literal">active_directory</code> and <code class="literal">pki</code>.
