<p>There are a few concepts that are core to machine learning in X-Pack. Understanding these
concepts from the outset will tremendously help ease the learning process.</p>
<h3><a id="ml-jobs"></a>Jobs<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/edit/6.0/docs/en/ml/jobs.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Machine learning jobs contain the configuration information and metadata
necessary to perform an analytics task. For a list of the properties associated
with a job, see <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.0/ml-job-resource.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Job Resources</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="ml-detectors"></a>Detectors<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/edit/6.0/docs/en/ml/jobs.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>As part of the configuration information that is associated with a job,
detectors define the type of analysis that needs to be done. They also specify
which fields to analyze. You can have more than one detector in a job, which
is more efficient than running multiple jobs against the same data. For a list
of the properties associated with detectors, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.0/ml-job-resource.html#ml-detectorconfig" class="ulink" target="_top">Detector Configuration Objects</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="ml-function-overview"></a>Analytical functions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/edit/6.0/docs/en/ml/jobs.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="ml-functions.html" title="Function Reference"><em>Function Reference</em></a>.</p>
<h3><a id="ml-dfeeds"></a>Datafeeds<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/edit/6.0/docs/en/ml/datafeeds.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Jobs can analyze either a one-off batch of data or continuously in real time.
Datafeeds retrieve data from Elasticsearch for analysis. Alternatively you can
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.0/ml-post-data.html" class="ulink" target="_top">POST data</a> from any source directly to an API.</p>
<h3><a id="ml-buckets"></a>Buckets<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/edit/6.0/docs/en/ml/buckets.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The X-Pack machine learning features use the concept of a bucket to divide the time
series into batches for processing. The <em>bucket span</em> is part of the
configuration information for a job. It defines the time interval that is used
to summarize and model the data. This is typically between 5 minutes to 1 hour
and it depends on your data characteristics. When you set the bucket span,
take into account the granularity at which you want to analyze, the frequency
of the input data, the typical duration of the anomalies, and the frequency at
which alerting is required.</p>
<h3><a id="ml-nodes"></a>Machine learning nodes<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/edit/6.0/docs/en/ml/architecture.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>A machine learning node is a node that has <code class="literal">xpack.ml.enabled</code> and <code class="literal">node.ml</code> set to <code class="literal">true</code>,
which is the default behavior. If you set <code class="literal">node.ml</code> to <code class="literal">false</code>, the node can
service API requests but it cannot run jobs. If you want to use X-Pack machine learning
features, there must be at least one machine learning node in your cluster. For more
information about this setting, see <a class="xref" href="xpack-settings.html" title="X-Pack Settings">X-Pack Settings</a>.</p>
