<p>The X-Pack machine learning features analyze the input stream of data, model its behavior,
and perform analysis based on the detectors you defined in your job. When an
event occurs outside of the model, that event is identified as an anomaly.</p>
<p>Result records for each anomaly are stored in <code class="literal">.ml-anomalies-*</code> indices in Elasticsearch.
By default, the name of the index where machine learning results are stored is labelled
<code class="literal">shared</code>, which corresponds to the <code class="literal">.ml-anomalies-shared</code> index.</p>
<p>You can use the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span> or the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span> in Kibana to
view the analysis results.</p>
<div class="variablelist">

Anomaly Explorer
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
This view contains swim lanes showing the maximum anomaly score over time.
There is an overall swim lane that shows the overall score for the job, and
also swim lanes for each influencer. By selecting a block in a swim lane, the
anomaly details are displayed alongside the original source data (where
applicable).
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
Single Metric Viewer
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
This view contains a chart that represents the actual and expected values over
time. This is only available for jobs that analyze a single time series and
where <code class="literal">model_plot_config</code> is enabled. As in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span>, anomalous
data points are shown in different colors depending on their score.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>By default when you view the results for a single metric job, the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Single Metric Viewer</strong></span> opens:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job1-analysis.jpg" alt="Single Metric Viewer for total-requests job">
</div>
</div>
<p>The blue line in the chart represents the actual data values. The shaded blue
area represents the bounds for the expected values. The area between the upper
and lower bounds are the most likely values for the model. If a value is outside
of this area then it can be said to be anomalous.</p>
<p>If you slide the time selector from the beginning of the data to the end of the
data, you can see how the model improves as it processes more data. At the
beginning, the expected range of values is pretty broad and the model is not
capturing the periodicity in the data. But it quickly learns and begins to
reflect the daily variation.</p>
<p>Any data points outside the range that was predicted by the model are marked
as anomalies. When you have high volumes of real-life data, many anomalies
might be found. These vary in probability from very likely to highly unlikely,
that is to say, from not particularly anomalous to highly anomalous. There
can be none, one or two or tens, sometimes hundreds of anomalies found within
each bucket. There can be many thousands found per job. In order to provide
a sensible view of the results, an <em>anomaly score</em> is calculated for each bucket
time interval. The anomaly score is a value from 0 to 100, which indicates
the significance of the observed anomaly compared to previously seen anomalies.
The highly anomalous values are shown in red and the low scored values are
indicated in blue. An interval with a high anomaly score is significant and
requires investigation.</p>
<p>Slide the time selector to a section of the time series that contains a red
anomaly data point. If you hover over the point, you can see more information
about that data point. You can also see details in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomalies</strong></span> section
of the viewer. For example:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job1-anomalies.jpg" alt="Single Metric Viewer Anomalies for total-requests job">
</div>
</div>
<p>For each anomaly you can see key details such as the time, the actual and
expected ("typical") values, and their probability.</p>
<p>By default, the table contains all anomalies that have a severity of "warning"
or higher in the selected section of the timeline. If you are only interested in
critical anomalies, for example, you can change the severity threshold for this
table.</p>
<p>The anomalies table also automatically calculates an interval for the data in
the table. If the time difference between the earliest and latest records in the
table is less than two days, the data is aggregated by hour to show the details
of the highest severity anomaly for each detector.  Otherwise, it is
aggregated by day. You can change the interval for the table, for example, to
show all anomalies.</p>
<p>You can see the same information in a different format by using the
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Anomaly Explorer</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job1-explorer.jpg" alt="Anomaly Explorer for total-requests job">
</div>
</div>
<p>Click one of the red sections in the swim lane to see details about the anomalies
that occurred in that time interval. For example:</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ml-gs-job1-explorer-anomaly.jpg" alt="Anomaly Explorer details for total-requests job">
</div>
</div>
<p>After you have identified anomalies, often the next step is to try to determine
the context of those situations. For example, are there other factors that are
contributing to the problem? Are the anomalies confined to particular
applications or servers? You can begin to troubleshoot these situations by
layering additional jobs or creating multi-metric jobs.</p>
