A <code class="literal">SSLHandshakeException</code> causes a connection to a node to fail and indicates
that there is a configuration issue. Some of the common exceptions are shown
below with tips on how to resolve these issues.

<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">java.security.cert.CertificateException: No name matching node01.example.com found</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates that a client connection was made to <code class="literal">node01.example.com</code> but the
certificate returned did not contain the name <code class="literal">node01.example.com</code>. In most
cases, the issue can be resolved by ensuring the name is specified during
certificate creation. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="ssl-tls.html" title="Setting Up SSL/TLS on a Cluster">Setting Up SSL/TLS on a Cluster</a>. Another scenario is
when the environment does not wish to use DNS names in certificates at all. In
this scenario, all settings in <code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code> should only use IP addresses
including the <code class="literal">network.publish_host</code> setting.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<span class="term">
<code class="literal">java.security.cert.CertificateException: No subject alternative names present</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates that a client connection was made to an IP address but the returned
certificate did not contain any <code class="literal">SubjectAlternativeName</code> entries. IP addresses
are only used for hostname verification if they are specified as a
<code class="literal">SubjectAlternativeName</code> during certificate creation. If the intent was to use
IP addresses for hostname verification, then the certificate will need to be
regenerated with the appropriate IP address. See <a class="xref" href="ssl-tls.html" title="Setting Up SSL/TLS on a Cluster">Setting Up SSL/TLS on a Cluster</a>.</p>

<code class="literal">javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: null cert chain</code> and <code class="literal">javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received fatal alert: bad_certificate</code>
</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code class="literal">SSLHandshakeException</code> indicates that a self-signed certificate was
returned by the client that is not trusted as it cannot be found in the
<code class="literal">truststore</code> or <code class="literal">keystore</code>. This <code class="literal">SSLException</code> is seen on the client side of
the connection.</p>

</span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This <code class="literal">SunCertPathBuilderException</code> indicates that a certificate was returned
during the handshake that is not trusted. This message is seen on the client
side of the connection. The <code class="literal">SSLException</code> is seen on the server side of the
connection. The CA certificate that signed the returned certificate was not
found in the <code class="literal">keystore</code> or <code class="literal">truststore</code> and needs to be added to trust this
certificate.</p>
