<p>Authentication identifies an individual. To gain access to restricted resources,
a user must prove their identity, via passwords, credentials, or some other
means (typically referred to as authentication tokens).</p>
<p>You can use the native support for managing and authenticating users, or
integrate with external user management systems such as LDAP and Active
Directory. For information about managing native users,
see <a class="xref" href="native-realm.html#managing-native-users" title="Managing Native Users">Managing Native Users</a>.</p>

<p>X-Pack security provides built-in user credentials to help you get up and running.
These users have a fixed set of privileges and cannot be authenticated until their
passwords have been set. The <code class="literal">elastic</code> user can be used to

<h4><a id="built-in-user-explanation"></a>How the Built-in Users Work<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/edit/6.1/docs/en/security/authentication.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>These built-in users are stored within a special <code class="literal">.security</code> index managed by
X-Pack security.
This means that, if the password is changed, or a user is disabled, then that
change is automatically reflected on each node in the cluster. It also means
that if your <code class="literal">.security</code> index is deleted, or restored from a snapshot, then
any changes you have applied will be lost.</p>
<p>Although they share the same API, the built-in users are separate and distinct
from users managed by the <a class="xref" href="native-realm.html" title="Native User Authentication">native realm</a>. Disabling the native
realm will not have any effect on the built-in users. The built-in users can
be disabled individually, using the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/security-api-users.html" class="ulink" target="_top">user management API</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="bootstrap-elastic-passwords"></a>The Elastic Bootstrap Password<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/edit/6.1/docs/en/security/authentication.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>When you install X-Pack, if the <code class="literal">elastic</code> user does not already have a password,
it uses a default bootstrap password. The bootstrap password is a transient
password that enables you to run the tools that set all the built-in user passwords.</p>
<p>By default, the bootstrap password is derived from a randomized <code class="literal">keystore.seed</code>
setting, which is added to the keystore when you install X-Pack. You do not need
to know or change this bootstrap password. If you have defined a
<code class="literal">bootstrap.password</code> setting in the keystore, however, that value is used instead.
For more information about interacting with the keystore, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/secure-settings.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Secure Settings</a>.</p>

<p>You must set the passwords for all built-in users.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">setup-passwords</code> tool is the simplest method to set the built-in users'
passwords for the first time. It uses the <code class="literal">elastic</code> user&#8217;s bootstrap password to
run user management API requests. For example, you can run the command in
an "interactive" mode, which prompts you to enter new passwords for the
<code class="literal">elastic</code>, <code class="literal">kibana</code>, and <code class="literal">logstash_system</code> users:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">bin/x-pack/setup-passwords interactive</pre>
</div>
<p>For more information about the command options, see
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/setup-passwords.html" class="ulink" target="_top">setup-passwords</a>.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>After you set a password for the <code class="literal">elastic</code> user, the bootstrap
password is no longer valid; you cannot run the <code class="literal">setup-passwords</code> command a
second time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Alternatively, you can set the initial passwords for the built-in users by using
the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Management &gt; Users</strong></span> page in Kibana or the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/security-api-change-password.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Change Password API</a>. These methods are
more complex. You must supply the <code class="literal">elastic</code> user and its bootstrap password to
log into Kibana or run the API. This requirement means that you cannot use the
default bootstrap password that is derived from the <code class="literal">keystore.seed</code> setting.
Instead, you must explicitly set a <code class="literal">bootstrap.password</code> setting in the keystore
before you start Elasticsearch. For example, the following command prompts you to enter a
new bootstrap password:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-shell">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-shell">bin/elasticsearch-keystore add "bootstrap.password"</pre>
</div>
<p>You can then start Elasticsearch and Kibana and use the <code class="literal">elastic</code> user and bootstrap
password to log into Kibana and change the passwords. Alternatively, you can
submit Change Password API requests for each built-in user. These methods are
better suited for changing your passwords after the initial setup is complete,
since at that point the bootstrap password is no longer required.</p>
<h4><a id="add-built-in-user-passwords"></a>Adding Built-in User Passwords To Kibana and Logstash<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/edit/6.1/docs/en/security/authentication.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>After the <code class="literal">kibana</code> user password is set, you need to update the Kibana server
with the new password by setting <code class="literal">elasticsearch.password</code> in the <code class="literal">kibana.yml</code>
configuration file:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">elasticsearch.password: kibanapassword</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code class="literal">logstash_system</code> user is used internally within Logstash when
monitoring is enabled for Logstash.</p>
<p>To enable this feature in Logstash, you need to update the Logstash
configuration with the new password by setting <code class="literal">xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password</code> in
the <code class="literal">logstash.yml</code> configuration file:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password: logstashpassword</pre>
</div>
<p>If you have upgraded from an older version of elasticsearch/x-pack,
the <code class="literal">logstash_system</code> user may have defaulted to <em>disabled</em> for security reasons.
Once the password has been changed, you can enable the user via the following API call:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<div class="console_code_copy" title="Copy to clipboard"></div>
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT _xpack/security/user/logstash_system/_enable</pre>
</div>

<p>This setting is deprecated. The elastic user no longer has a default password.

<p>X-Pack security has three <em>internal</em> users (<code class="literal">_system</code>, <code class="literal">_xpack</code>, and <code class="literal">_xpack_security</code>)
that are responsible for the operations that take place inside an Elasticsearch cluster.</p>
<p>These users are only used by requests that originate from within the cluster.
For this reason, they cannot be used to authenticate against the API and there
is no password to manage or reset.</p>
<p>From time-to-time you may find a reference to one of these users inside your
logs, including <a class="xref" href="auditing.html" title="Auditing Security Events">audit logs</a>.</p>
